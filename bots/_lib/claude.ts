/**
 * Claude Code CLI wrapper for bots.
 *
 * Bots delegate the "intelligent" part of their work to a headless `claude -p`
 * invocation. The orchestration (data plumbing, dedup, action) stays in TS;
 * the prompt-driven analysis and tool-call sequence belongs to Claude.
 *
 * Auth: CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN env var. The Claude Code CLI reads it
 * automatically — no flag needed. Bills against the Claude account's
 * subscription rather than per-token API spend.
 *
 * Transparency: Claude is invoked with `--output-format stream-json --verbose`
 * so every tool call, tool result, and assistant message lands as one JSON
 * event per line. The wrapper writes the raw JSONL to a transcript file (for
 * a future agent to read) AND renders a human-readable summary to stdout
 * (for live workflow log viewing). See `bots/README.md` "Improving the bot"
 * for how the transcripts feed the replay loop.

 * Cost note: Opus is more expensive per-token, but bots run 1-2 times
 * per cron and read ~30-50KB. The dollar cost is cents per call. The

 *
 * Matches EITHER:
 *   - a `result` event with `api_error_status` 401 or 403, OR
 *   - a `result` event whose error text names the entitlement failure
 *     (the observed 2026-06-24 wording was "Your organization has
 *     disabled Claude subscription access for Claude Code").
 *
 * Why the text fallback: `api_error_status` is confirmed present for
 * 429 (see `detectRateLimit`), but the June 2026 transcripts that
 * carried the 403 aged out of the 90-day artifact retention before
 * the exact field shape could be confirmed. Matching both shapes is
 * defensive; if the status code is present we catch it, and if the
 * CLI only surfaced prose we still catch it.
 *
 * Why this matters: without it, a momentary org-level auth blip makes
 * Agent A exit non-zero, which routes to `agent-a-failure` →
 * `escalate-failure` → a TERMINAL `needs-human` skip entry +
 * `ready-for-human` + closed issue. That is what froze cut #524 (and
 * with it the whole review-workflow dependency chain) for three
 * months after a single transient 403 on 2026-06-24 — the auth was
 * working again by 07-02, but the skip-list entry made the cut
 * permanently invisible to the cron.
 *

 * that branch is the pre-existing behavior (escalate a cut that could
 * have stayed on the queue).
