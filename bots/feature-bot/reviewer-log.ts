/**
 * Reviewer-log — durable record of every Agent B verdict for feature-bot.
 *
 * Append-only JSONL (`bots/feature-bot/reviewer-log.jsonl`). One line per
 * Agent B verdict: APPROVE, REJECT, NEEDS_INPUT, or NEEDS_HUMAN. Persists
 * the reviewer's reasoning so a future monthly compactor can surface
 * cross-cut patterns into lessons-learned.md (deferred — see
 * design-feature-bot.md "Memory" section + Q7 lock).
 *
 * Distinct from skip-list (per-cut rejection memory, gates future runs)
 * and lessons-learned.md (compacted prose loaded into Agent A's prompt).
 * The reviewer-log is the RAW SIGNAL the future compactor would read.
 *
 * Why per-bot: bot-specific fingerprint shape (`{ issueNumber }` here,
 * peer-rooted from fix-bot's) — same rule as skip-list. Rule 38
 * (symmetric-bot audits) keeps the file shape identical to fix-bot's so
 * the future compactor can be lifted across bots when it earns its place.
