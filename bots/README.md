# Bots

Repo-scoped bots that run on GitHub Actions cron schedules. Each bot:

- Lives in its own subdirectory (`<bot-name>/`)
- Has an `index.ts` entry point + a `prompt.md` for the headless Claude call
- Shares cross-bot infrastructure from `_lib/` (GitHub API wrapping via Octokit, Claude CLI invocation, git-tree ops, reviewer-verdict parser)
- Owns its bot-specific memory + parsers locally (per-bot `skip-list.ts`, `knip-parse.ts`, `stryker-parse.ts`, `past-pr.ts`) — different bots have different schemas, so memory doesn't leak across bot boundaries
- Has a corresponding workflow at `.github/workflows/<bot-name>.yml`

`bots/` is a top-level peer of `apps/`, `packages/`, `tools/`. They live at the
root because they're autonomous infrastructure — different audience and lifecycle
from `tools/` (developer/operator utilities run on demand).

## Conventions

- **Auth**: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (Claude account subscription) + `GH_TOKEN` (GitHub Actions default token). Both flow through env; never hardcoded. The OAuth token is an org-level secret; new bots inherit it automatically.
- **Permissions**: workflow declares `actions: read` + `issues: write` (most bots) + nothing else. Add `contents: write` only when the bot commits to the repo.
- **Failure isolation**: workflow uses `continue-on-error: true`. Bot's `index.ts` wraps each per-target investigation in a try/catch so one bad investigation doesn't kill the run.
- **Dry-run**: every bot supports `DRY_RUN=1` env to list candidates without invoking Claude. Used for local testing and prompt iteration.
- **Cron**: schedule for results visible by the maintainer's morning review (09:00 CEST). Bots fire 02:00–04:00 UTC = 04:00–06:00 CEST, with 0–3h GitHub Actions skew baked in. Defensive timing guarantees worst-case completion by 09:00 CEST.

## Adding a new bot

1. `cp -r flake-watcher <new-bot>`
2. Rewrite `<new-bot>/index.ts` for the new task; reuse `_lib/` helpers
3. Rewrite `<new-bot>/prompt.md` with the new task's investigation steps
4. Add the npm script: `"<new-bot>": "tsx <new-bot>/index.ts"` in `package.json`
5. Copy `.github/workflows/flake-watcher.yml` to `.github/workflows/<new-bot>.yml`; update the cron, the run command, and the description

If three+ bots end up needing the same helper (e.g., posting structured comments, parsing test output), extract to `_lib/`. Until then, inline — and if the helper is bot-specific (a parser for one tool's output, a memory shape with one bot's domain types), keep it under that bot's directory even if it grows large. Each bot owns its own memory and domain modules; `_lib/` is reserved for genuinely cross-bot infrastructure.

## Architecture: producer vs consumer — where does work live?

The single most important question when designing a new bot is **what work lives in the orchestrator (TS code) vs the prompt (Claude)**. Get this wrong and the bot will either fail with context overruns, file duplicate noise, or do brittle pattern-matching that breaks on language variation.

**Rule of thumb:**

| Kind of work | Lives in | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Parsing, filtering, paginating, summarising large inputs | **Orchestrator (TS)** | Deterministic; testable with vitest; doesn't burn context |
| Deduping against prior bot output | **Orchestrator (TS)** | Cheap `gh issue list` filters + outcome-tag regex; needs to be reliable across runs |
| Identity / classification of inputs (which producer filed this issue?) | **Orchestrator (TS)** | Outcome-tag regex is more reliable than asking Claude to recognize bot-authored bodies |
| Interpretation, classification of natural language | **Prompt (Claude)** | Judgment work; pattern-match across context |
| Writing prose (issue bodies, comments, fix recommendations) | **Prompt (Claude)** | Generative work; needs context awareness |
| Picking which fix to apply, which test to write | **Prompt (Claude)** | Judgment work; benefits from reading the actual code |
| Deciding "the bug is too vague — apply ready-for-human and bail" | **Prompt (Claude)** | Self-awareness; needs to see the bug's repro to decide |

**Why this matters:** mutation-watcher's first iteration asked Claude to parse a 3 MB Stryker HTML report (`mutation-watcher/prompt.md` step 1: "extract the JSON via grep + node -e"). Claude *did* parse it correctly — and exhausted its context window doing so, exiting before filing any issues. The fix was `bots/mutation-watcher/stryker-parse.ts` — 50 lines of TS that handle parsing, summarising, and per-file capping. Claude now consumes a small JSON summary per file (~few KB), one Claude call per file, and writes focused issue bodies. Same architecture pattern as triage-bot's per-issue Claude call.

**Symptoms that tell you the producer/consumer split is wrong:**

- **Autocompact thrashes** ("the context refilled to the limit within 3 turns") — Claude is being asked to hold more state than fits. Move parsing/state-tracking to TS.
- **Brittle regex parsers in the orchestrator** to match Claude's output shapes — you're asking the consumer to deal with a producer that writes prose. Either tighten the producer's prompt (lock body shape) OR move what you're parsing back into TS-generated structured output.
- **Repeated `gh issue list --state open` searches that re-file duplicates** of recently-closed issues — dedup logic that only looks at open issues misses the fixed-but-still-flagged case. Search `--state all` and skip on closed-match.
- **Silent failures** (exit 1 with no comment, no label change) — orchestrator should catch non-zero exits, mine the transcript for the failure mode, post a maintainer-readable comment. See `bots/fix-bot/failure-diagnostic.ts` for the pattern.

**When in doubt:** prefer pushing work to the orchestrator. The TS code is testable (vitest), debugger-friendly (real stack traces, not transcript archaeology), and doesn't burn context budget. Claude's strengths are judgment and prose — use them there, not for stuff a parser could do deterministically.

## Running locally

```bash
# Dry-run (no Claude invocation)
DRY_RUN=1 GITHUB_REPOSITORY=gazetta-studio/gazetta-studio GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) \
  npm run flake-watcher -w @gazetta/bots

# Real run (invokes Claude — uses local CLI auth)
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=gazetta-studio/gazetta-studio GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) \
  npm run flake-watcher -w @gazetta/bots
```

## Active bots

| Bot | Trigger | Input (label-driven, except producer bots) | Output | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `flake-watcher` | Daily 02:00 UTC + workflow_dispatch | CI events (run_attempt >= 2) — not labels | New issue with `bug` + `flake` + `area: X` + `ready-for-agent` (+ `recurring-flake` when applicable) | **Producer** — self-classifies, bypasses triage |
| `mutation-watcher` | `workflow_run` on Mutation completion + workflow_dispatch | Latest Mutation artifact — not labels | New issue with `bug` + `area: X` + `ready-for-agent` per source file with surviving mutants | **Producer** — self-classifies, bypasses triage |
| `dead-code-watcher` | Weekly Sat 02:30 UTC + workflow_dispatch | knip JSON output (files, exports, types, deps) — not labels; ≥30-day stable filter | Delete-PR per safe finding (full pipeline, NOT delegated to fix-bot) OR skip-list-entry PR | **Producer** — autonomous fixer with durable memory + generator-critic reviewer loop |
| `bots-compact` | Monthly 1st Sat 03:00 UTC + workflow_dispatch | All memoryful bots' skip-lists (one job per bot) | Per-bot PRs: glob-rule compaction (dead-code-watcher), lessons-learned.md rewrite (fix-bot) | Memory compactor |
| `triage-bot` | Daily 03:00 UTC + workflow_dispatch | Open issue lacking all of `bug`, `enhancement`, `triage-uncertain`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`, `needs-info` | One of `bug` / `enhancement` / `triage-uncertain` + `area: X`. Reproducible bug also gets `ready-for-agent`. | Classifier |
| `discovery-prep-bot` | Daily 04:00 UTC + workflow_dispatch | `enhancement` AND lacks all of `ready-for-human`, `ready-for-agent`, `wontfix`, `needs-info` | Research comment + `ready-for-human` label | Researcher |
| `fix-bot` | Daily 04:00 UTC + workflow_dispatch | `bug` + `ready-for-agent` AND lacks all of `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`, `needs-info` AND no `fix-bot-attempted` since reopen AND no skip-list match | PR (two commits: failing test + fix) on approve, skip-list entry on reject/needs-human, OR stuck-comment + `ready-for-human` on stuck path | Implementer — generator-critic reviewer loop + durable memory + lessons-learned |
| `feature-bot` | Daily 04:30 UTC + workflow_dispatch | `enhancement` + `ready-for-agent` AND lacks all of `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`, `needs-info` AND `**Depends on**:` refs all closed | PR (failing test + impl commits) on APPROVE, sub-issue closed + skip-list entry on NEEDS_HUMAN, sub-issue comment + `needs-info` label on NEEDS_INPUT | Implementer — feature cuts via generator-critic reviewer loop + durable memory + lessons-learned. See [design-feature-bot.md](../.claude/rules/design-feature-bot.md). |
| `mutation-area-picker` | Weekly Sun 03:30 UTC + workflow_dispatch | `stryker.config.json` + git/GitHub cross-references (AI-pairing, churn, flake, fix-rate) | Draft PR adding/swapping/removing one module in `mutate` glob, OR silent NOOP | **Strategic portfolio manager** — owns mutation scope under runtime budget.

Empirical eviction per [ADR-0014](../docs/adr/0014-mutation-eviction-by-empirical-evidence.md). |

**Producer bots vs triage-bot.** Producer bots (`flake-watcher`,
`mutation-watcher`, `dead-code-watcher`) consume CI signal or
static-analysis output and self-classify their output, bypassing
triage-bot. Triage-bot's input contract excludes issues already
carrying `bug` / `enhancement` / `triage-uncertain`, so producer-bot
output flows straight into fix-bot's queue. The signal IS the
validation; no triage step adds value.

**Autonomous fixers vs pipeline producers.** `flake-watcher` and
`mutation-watcher` are *pipeline* producers: they file issues that
fix-bot picks up later. `dead-code-watcher` is an *autonomous*
producer: it files PRs directly, no fix-bot involvement. The
difference is whether the bot can complete the loop end-to-end.
Dead-code-watcher can because deletion's "test" is "existing tests
pass" — fix-bot's TDD-first contract doesn't compose with deletion.

**Generator-critic loop pattern.** Dead-code-watcher was the first bot
with two Claude agents in series. Fix-bot and feature-bot follow the
same pattern. Agent A (cleanup / implementation) investigates and
makes changes locally; Agent B (reviewer) inspects the diff fresh —
no shared transcript — and votes APPROVE / REJECT / NEEDS_HUMAN
(feature-bot also has a NEEDS_INPUT verdict — see
[design-feature-bot.md](../.claude/rules/design-feature-bot.md) Q6).
On REJECT, the orchestrator resets the working tree and re-runs
Agent A with the reviewer's specific note. Up to `MAX_ATTEMPTS`
iterations (default 5, configurable) before the bot gives up and
records `needs-human` in the skip-list.

The reviewer catches failure modes the test-suite gate can't:
hidden public-API surfaces (JSDoc `@public` markers), accidental
refactors disguised as deletions, misleading commit messages, and
architecturally-questionable deletions (extension points,
documented contracts). Reviewer has `Bash` + `Read` only — no
ability to push code or modify the diff. Verdict line format
`VERDICT: APPROVE|REJECT|NEEDS_HUMAN` followed by `Reasoning:` or
`Note:` is parsed by the orchestrator.

**Durable memory pattern.** Three bots have cross-run memory:
dead-code-watcher, fix-bot, and feature-bot. Each has three memory
surfaces, each with its own persistence model:

  - **`skip-list.json`** (per-bot, committed to repo) — durable
    "don't try this again" decisions. dead-code-watcher's is keyed
    by knip fingerprint; fix-bot's by GitHub issue number.
    Persists via PR + merge to main; the bot reads on checkout.
  - **`lessons-learned.md`** (per-bot, committed to repo) — distilled
    cross-finding/cross-issue patterns. Loaded into Agent A's prompt
    every run. The monthly compactor rewrites holistically;
    persists via PR + merge to main.
  - **`reviewer-log.jsonl`** (per-bot, **NOT** committed) — every
    Agent B verdict (APPROVE / REJECT / NEEDS_HUMAN) appended by the
    daily bot. The raw input the compactor reads to produce
    lessons-learned. Persists via `actions/cache@v4` keyed
    `{bot}-reviewer-log-v1` — see "Reviewer-log persistence" below.

Each memoryful bot also has a Past-PR feedback loop (e.g. `bots/dead-code-watcher/past-pr.ts`):
before investigating, the bot checks if there's a recent PR for
this fingerprint. Closed-not-merged → mine the rejection reason →
add to skip-list. Open → wait. Merged → no-op (the underlying
issue should be gone). Mining happens inside Agent A's flow on
retry attempts, not in the orchestrator's pre-pass.

**Compaction differs per bot.**
  - **dead-code-watcher's compactor** does two things in one PR:
    generalizes 3+ skip-list entries sharing a pattern into one
    glob-scoped rule (skip-list shrinks AND becomes more powerful),
    AND rewrites lessons-learned.md from cross-finding patterns
    in the reviewer-log.
  - **fix-bot's compactor** rewrites lessons-learned.md from both
    skip-list patterns AND reviewer-log patterns. The skip-list
    stays per-issue (most rejections are per-issue-unique).

Both compactors also **prune the reviewer-log** to a bounded window
(default 200 most-recent entries) after Claude succeeds — the
compactor IS the memory-trimmer for that surface, keeping the cached
file size bounded across many months of runs.

Both run in the same `bots-compact.yml` workflow (one job per bot)
on the first Saturday of each month.

### Reviewer-log persistence

The reviewer-log is operational signal, not the forensic record
(audit log + transcripts artifact serve that purpose). It persists
via `actions/cache@v4` between runs:

  - **Cache key:** `{bot-name}-reviewer-log-v1`. Bump the suffix
    if the JSONL schema changes incompatibly.
  - **Cache path:** `bots/{bot-name}/reviewer-log.jsonl`.
  - **Workflows that touch it:** `dead-code-watcher.yml`,
    `fix-bot.yml` (both write), and the corresponding jobs in
    `bots-compact.yml` (both write — they prune after producing
    the lessons rewrite).
  - **Eviction:** GH Actions caches evict after 7 days from last
    access. Every daily cron touches the cache → effectively
    permanent under daily-bot cadence. A 7+ day bot outage = log
    gone; recovery is a fresh start (lessons-learned.md remains in
    the repo).

**Single-instance invariant.** Two workflows of the same bot must
never run concurrently — they'd race on the cache and lose entries.
Enforced by workflow-level `concurrency:` groups with literal
names matching across `{bot}.yml` and the corresponding job in
`bots-compact.yml`:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: dead-code-watcher    # or 'fix-bot'
  cancel-in-progress: false   # queue, don't cancel in-flight work
```

See ADR-0011 for the full design rationale.

### Pipeline shape (label-driven)

```
Producer bots — bypass triage-bot, go straight to fix-bot's queue:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
flake-watcher (cron 02:00 UTC)         mutation-watcher (workflow_run on Mutation)
    ↓ files issue with                     ↓ files issue with
      bug + flake + ready-for-agent          bug + ready-for-agent
                          \           /
                           \         /
Human-filed issues — go through triage:
──────────────────────────────────────
issue filed by maintainer / contributor (no labels)
    ↓
triage-bot (cron 03:00 UTC) — input: open + no classification
    ├─→ confident bug + reproducible → applies bug + ready-for-agent
    │
    ├─→ confident enhancement → applies enhancement
    │       ↓
    │   discovery-prep-bot (cron 04:00 UTC) — input: enhancement + not yet handed off
    │       ↓ posts research comment + applies ready-for-human
    │   maintainer reads comment, starts grilling at their pace
    │
    └─→ triage-uncertain → maintainer's morning queue
            gh issue list --label triage-uncertain

All confident-bug paths converge here:
─────────────────────────────────────
                          ↓
                          ↓ (bug + ready-for-agent from any source)
                          ↓
fix-bot (cron 04:00 UTC) — input: bug + ready-for-agent + no prior fix-bot comment
    ↓ EITHER opens draft PR (failing test + fix),
      OR posts stuck-comment + applies ready-for-human
maintainer reviews PR, merges
```

**Pipeline state lives in labels, not in code or workflow runs.** Each bot's input is a label query; each bot's output is a label mutation. To re-run any bot on an issue, remove its output label — the next cron picks it up. To opt-out an issue, apply a terminal-state label (`wontfix` / `ready-for-human`).

**Maintainer queries:**

```bash
# What did the bot flag for me?
gh issue list --label triage-uncertain

# What's in design-grilling territory? (read the latest comment to know
# whether it's discovery-prep-bot's research or fix-bot's stuck case)
gh issue list --label ready-for-human

# What's queued for fix-bot?
gh issue list --label ready-for-agent

# What's waiting on info or a maintainer decision? (see "needs-info semantics" below)
gh issue list --label needs-info
```

`ready-for-human` is shared between discovery-prep-bot ("research done, grilling can start") and fix-bot ("stuck — needs human"). Disambiguate by reading the most recent bot comment's outcome tag.

**`needs-info` semantics (widened for feature-bot).** The label means "bot
must exclude from queue; requires additional information to proceed." Two
sources of the information may be: (1) the issue reporter (triage-bot's
"could not reproduce" path) OR (2) a design decision from the maintainer
(feature-bot's NEEDS_INPUT escalation when Agent A hits a question it
can't resolve from the cut spec + design doc). The comment thread carries
specifics in both cases. Remove the label (or have the bot remove it on
its next cron after the comment thread resolves) to re-trigger bot
processing.

Each bot is independent. Failures are isolated (per-bot try/catch + workflow `continue-on-error`). No chained workflow_dispatch — each bot's cron is the trigger, the issue's label state is the input.

## Improving a bot

Bots are designed for an agent (you, in a future session) to improve over time.
Three signals make the loop work:

1. **JSONL transcripts** — every Claude invocation writes one line per event
   (tool call, tool result, assistant text) to `bots/transcripts/`. CI uploads
   them as the `<bot-name>-transcripts` artifact (90-day retention). To read a
   past run's transcripts: `gh run download <run-id> -n flake-watcher-transcripts`.
2. **Decision-log convention** — bot prompts ask Claude to articulate
   load-bearing decisions inline (`> Decision: ...`). The transcript captures
   the WHY, not just the WHAT.
3. **Outcome tags** — every comment / new issue ends with
   `<!-- flake-watcher: run=$RUN_ID -->`. Lets you query
   `gh issue list --search "flake-watcher: run=12345"` to find what the bot
   touched in any past run, joining intent (transcript) with outcome (issue
   activity).

### Replay loop (the actual improvement workflow)

```bash
# 1. Pick a recent workflow run
gh run list --workflow=flake-watcher.yml --limit 5

# 2. Read transcripts to find quality issues — over-eager dedup, missed
#    root-cause class, etc. Outcome tags let you cross-check what each
#    investigation actually produced on the issue tracker.
gh run download <run-id> -n flake-watcher-transcripts -D /tmp/transcripts

# 3. Edit the prompt (bots/<bot-name>/prompt.md)

# 4. Replay the same flakes against the new prompt — writes side-by-side
#    transcripts to bots/transcripts/<bot>/replay-from-<source-run>/.
npm run replay -w @gazetta/bots <bot-name> <source-run-id>

# 5. Diff <run-id>-original.jsonl vs <run-id>-replay.jsonl per investigation;
#    decide if the change is an improvement.

# 6. Open a PR with the prompt change; cite which past runs replay improved.
```

**Replay safety**: replays invoke real Claude with real tools. The current
prompt may instruct Claude to file/comment on issues — replays will too.
Always inspect transcripts before shipping a prompt change. Future work:
add a `REPLAY=1` env that the prompt can read to suppress side effects.
