Walk every open PR. For each, do a real review (not a summary). Always ask before merging.

## Loop

1. **List open PRs** — `gh pr list --json number,title,author,isDraft,createdAt,mergeable,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup` and present a table sorted oldest-first.

2. **For each PR**, in order:
   - **Read PR metadata** — `gh pr view <N> --json title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,additions,deletions,changedFiles,files,commits`
   - **Read the linked issue** if one exists — `gh issue view <N>` (look for `Closes #X` in body)
   - **Read the diff** — `gh pr diff <N>` (or use Read on changed files for big diffs)
   - **Fact-check load-bearing claims** — see the "Fact-check" section below
   - **Check CI** — if green, note it; if no checks, diagnose (see "CI not firing"); if running, monitor or note pending
   - **Detect stacked PRs** — see "Stacked-PR detection"
   - **Recommend** — merge / close / push back / wait for CI — with reasoning
   - **Ask the user** before merging — `AskUserQuestion` or wait for confirmation

3. **After all PRs reviewed**, summarize what was done + what's outstanding.

## Reading bot-authored PRs

Some PRs are opened by autonomous bots (fix-bot, feature-bot, dead-code-watcher). They carry structured body sections you should read explicitly — these are the bot's proof-of-work, and the maintainer's job is to verify the bot's claims match the diff.

### Detect bot authorship

Bot-authored PRs end with an HTML-comment marker:

| Marker | Bot |
|---|---|
| `<!-- fix-bot: issue=N run=R -->` | fix-bot |
| `<!-- feature-bot: issue=N run=R -->` | feature-bot |
| `<!-- dead-code-watcher: ... -->` | dead-code-watcher |

PRs without a bot marker are maintainer-authored or external — read the PR body as prose.

### What the bot's PR body contains

After the bot identifier, both fix-bot and feature-bot inject Agent A's verbatim SUMMARY block under `## What Agent A did`. The SUMMARY contains:

```
<2-4 sentence prose>

Mode: behavioral | structural | mixed         (fix-bot only — feature-bot cuts are always behavioral by design)

Runtime exercise:
<per-bullet, per-path input + actual output>

Wider suite: <pass>/<total> pass; exit code <N>

Discovered: (optional; omit when empty)
- <one-line description of adjacent pre-existing bug observed during exercise>
```

### What to check in each section

**Mode** (fix-bot): cross-check the declared mode against the diff:
- `behavioral` → diff should change runtime behavior (logic, conditions, return values, status codes). Pure extraction / rename / comment-rot = mode is wrong.
- `structural` → diff should have NO behavior change. Any changed return value, conditional, or status code = mode is wrong.
- `mixed` → diff has both; verify each part.

Agent B already does this check; you're the second pair of eyes. If you see a mismatch, that's grounds to push back even when Agent B approved.

**Runtime exercise**: for `behavioral` / `mixed` modes, verify:
- Repro path output matches what the linked issue says should happen
- Wider suite shows zero failures (`/<N> pass; exit code 0`)
- If the fix touches symmetric surfaces (page+fragment kinds, etc.), both are exercised

For `structural` mode, the line reads `Runtime exercise: N/A — <reason>`. That's expected. The failing test pins the structural invariant; no behavioral surface to exercise.

**Discovered**: each entry is a candidate follow-up issue. The bot intentionally surfaces these instead of widening scope. Treat them as input to the "Follow-up issues" workflow below.

### Anti-patterns to catch

These are reasons to push back on a bot PR even if Agent B approved:

- **Tests-double-as-exercise**: SUMMARY's `Runtime exercise:` cites unit tests instead of a real runtime exercise. The exercise must be throwaway proof (`node -e`, `tmp-` script, CLI invocation). Tests are the TDD contract; the exercise is comprehension-grounding; mixing them defeats the anti-tautology purpose.
- **Mode-vs-diff mismatch**: declared `structural` but the diff changes behavior, OR declared `behavioral` but the diff is pure refactor. Either direction is a real problem; push back.
- **Discovered items that are load-bearing**: a `Discovered:` entry that's actually the incomplete-fix case the bot should have addressed in-scope. Push back with "this isn't a follow-up; finish the fix."
- **Leftover `tmp-*` files**: the runtime exercise's scratch script appears in the diff. Bot was supposed to delete before commit. Push back.

## Pruning proof-of-work tests in bot PRs

Bot-authored PRs with `Mode: structural` sometimes include tests that exist only to prove the bot DID the structural work — not to assert ongoing invariants the codebase needs. These are "proof-of-work" tests: they read production source files with `readFile` / `readdir` and regex-match the source text. Useful at TDD-contract time (Agent A's failing-test commit had to fail before the fix landed); operationally redundant once the diff is on main.

### Detection criterion

A test is a proof-of-work candidate when ALL its `it()` blocks have assertions matching the shape:

```ts
const source = await readFile(join(__dirname, '..', 'src', '...'), 'utf8')
expect(source).toMatch(/.../)
// or:
expect(matchCount).toBe(N)
```

— reading a path under `src/` (or any production source dir) and regex-asserting its content. Test files that ONLY do this can be deleted; the production diff itself is the load-bearing proof.

Mixed test files — where SOME `it()` blocks read source files but OTHERS import the symbol and call it with real inputs (`await import(...)` + `expect(fn(arg)).toBe(...)`) — keep the behavior tests, drop only the file-content `it()` blocks.

### What to keep

- **Behavior tests**: import the symbol from the production module, call it with real inputs, assert on outputs. These exercise runtime branches and catch real regressions.
- **Structural invariant tests the compiler CANNOT catch**: "no inline copies of `lookupManifest` remain in route files" — the compiler allows shadow definitions; this test is the load-bearing rule-15 enforcement. Note: this IS a file-content test, BUT it pins an invariant TypeScript can't enforce. Keep it.

The distinction — **drift PROBABILITY through normal work, not drift POSSIBILITY in principle** (per team-preferences rule 41):
- File-content test that pins something the codebase's CURRENT state already proves (imports resolve, exports exist, symbols are defined) → **proof-of-work; drop**
- File-content test that pins something a developer could RE-INTRODUCE WITHOUT NOTICING during normal edits ("no `console.log` in production", "no calls to deprecated `oldApi()` remain" — every careless add re-breaks it) → **keep, or better, make it a lint rule**
- File-content test that pins something that only drifts via a DELIBERATE, against-the-grain action ("no inline copy of `lookupManifest` shadows the import we also kept") → **drop**. Nobody re-adds a shadow definition by accident; the production diff is the proof the extraction happened, and the bot's 4-step revert+rerun already validated the cut. Re-asserting on every CI run via brittle regex (blind to renames / arrow-fn rewrites / reformatting) is proof-of-work redundancy.

The sharper test: "would the compiler or a lint rule be the right home for this, AND is the drift it guards against something a developer would do without noticing?" If a developer would never accidentally do it → **prune the block, keep the behavior tests**. If it's genuinely drift-prone → file a follow-up to replace the regex-over-source assertion with an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` rule (string-matching source enforces the *spelling*, not the *invariant*).

**`Mode: structural` one-shot extraction cuts are the canonical prune case.** rule-15 extractions, dead-code removals, and rename-the-helper refactors all produce file-content tests whose only job was to be red-before-green. Once the bot validated the cut, that job is done. (Reference: PR #474, 2026-05-31 — the skill's earlier "keep compiler-invisible invariants" phrasing kept a proof-of-work block the maintainer correctly flagged for pruning. Rule 41 was the retrospective fix.)

### Process

**Default to an additive commit, not a rebase-and-amend (per team-preferences rule 42).** When the maintainer confirms pruning, the lighter path is usually right: edit the test file, commit the change as a NEW commit on top of the bot's untouched commits, plain `git push`. This leaves the bot's commits byte-identical, fires the `synchronize` CI event normally (your account identity, not `GITHUB_TOKEN`), and keeps the bot's transcript-referenced SHAs valid. Verify the trimmed test file still fails red-before-green (move the production module aside, confirm the remaining tests fail; restore) — the contract must survive the prune.

**The amend/force-push path below is the EXCEPTION** — reach for it only when the edit must live INSIDE the bot's failing-test commit for the TDD contract to hold (e.g. the test file is commit 1 of 2 and you're removing a block that was part of what made commit 1 red). For "drop a redundant block" the additive commit is simpler and non-destructive. (If you START additive and later amend YOUR OWN top commit — not the bot's — `--force-with-lease` is fine; you're rewriting your commit, not the bot's history.)

The rest of this section covers the destructive amend path. This workflow EDITS a bot's PR branch + force-pushes — destructive and irreversible from the maintainer's review surface. **Every step requires explicit human confirmation, not a default-yes prompt.**

When you spot a proof-of-work candidate:

1. **Surface the candidates inline** — list each proof-of-work test in your review output with file path + line numbers + per-test rationale ("test on `tests/foo.test.ts:42` reads `src/admin-api/lookup-manifest.ts` and regex-matches the export; the compiler already enforces this; safe to drop"). Do NOT propose action yet.
2. **AskUserQuestion: "Do you want me to prune these tests from PR #N?"** with options "Yes, proceed with pruning" / "No, leave the PR as-is" / "Skip specific tests". If the user picks No or Skip, do NOT touch the branch. Default behavior on uncertainty is leave-as-is.
3. **On explicit Yes**: confirm a SECOND time before running destructive commands. State exactly what you're about to do: "I will checkout `fix/issue-NNN`, delete tests X/Y/Z from `<file>`, amend the failing-test commit, force-push to the bot's branch. The fix commit will be rebased on top unchanged. Proceed?" Wait for an explicit "yes" / "go" / "proceed" — not just "ok" (too ambiguous given this is destructive).
4. **On second confirm**: `gh pr checkout <N>` to switch to the bot's branch.
5. Edit the test file to delete the confirmed tests.
6. **Re-verify the TDD contract.** Run `git revert HEAD --no-edit` to revert the fix commit, then `npx vitest run <test-file>` — must FAIL. Then `git reset --hard origin/<branch>` to restore, then `npx vitest run <test-file>` — must PASS. If the contract no longer holds (test commit doesn't fail in isolation), the dropped tests WERE load-bearing; abort, restore the branch (`git reset --hard origin/<branch>`), and report to the maintainer.
7. **Amend the failing-test commit, not main.** The test commit (commit 1 of 2) needs the edit; the fix commit (commit 2) stays untouched. Shape:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~2          # mark commit 1 (test) as `edit`
   # edit the test file; remove the proof-of-work it() blocks
   git add <test-file>
   git commit --amend --no-edit
   git rebase --continue          # re-applies commit 2 on top
   ```
8. Re-run the 4-step tautology check on the rebased branch to confirm: test commit fails in isolation, fix commit turns it green.
9. **Third confirmation before force-pushing.** "Tautology check passed on the rebased branch. Force-push to `<branch>`?" Wait for explicit yes.
10. `git push --force-with-lease` to the bot's branch. The PR auto-updates.
11. Verify CI re-runs green before recommending merge.

### Why three confirmation gates

Force-pushing to a PR branch is destructive: it rewrites history the bot's transcripts reference + invalidates any in-flight CI runs + can confuse future bot retries that expect a specific commit SHA. The three gates correspond to three irreversible thresholds:

- **Gate 1 (AskUserQuestion)**: maintainer learns about the pruning candidates and chooses whether to engage at all. Default-no.
- **Gate 2 (second confirm before checkout)**: maintainer reviews the exact commands the skill will run. Last chance before the working tree changes.
- **Gate 3 (third confirm before force-push)**: maintainer reviews the rebased state + the tautology-check evidence. Last chance before the remote branch changes.

If the maintainer says "ok" at gate 1 but doesn't explicitly authorize the force-push, you've still done useful work (local branch edited + verified) but the remote PR is untouched. They can inspect the local result, then explicitly confirm or roll back.

### When NOT to prune

- The bot PR has only ONE test file and ALL its `it()` blocks are file-content checks → don't delete the whole file; the failing-test contract requires SOMETHING red-before-fix. Either keep one minimal structural assertion OR open a follow-up to fix the prompt that produced this shape (fix-bot's per-issue.md sub-case 3d should already steer it correctly).
- Mode: behavioral or mixed → behavioral fixes shouldn't have proof-of-work tests in the first place; if you see them, that's a signal the bot misclassified Mode. Push back on the PR with a Note rather than editing.

## Fact-check load-bearing claims (rule 20)

Don't trust the PR body's root-cause description without verifying it. For every claim that drives the fix, check it against actual code:

- **Race condition claims** → trace the actual event sequence in the code. "X happens before Y" — is that synchronous or asynchronous? Sync handlers (DOM `addEventListener`, Vue `@click`)? Or scheduled (Promise microtask, Vue scheduler, browser event loop)?
- **"This was the root cause" claims** → can you find code that supports it? Or is the PR description guessing? If guessing, the fix may not address the real cause.
- **API/library behavior claims** → check the source if it's in `node_modules/` or via WebFetch to official docs for external services.
- **"X is sync" / "X is async" claims** → grep the implementation. Vue listeners are sync (`addEventListener`). React's setState is async. `localStorage.setItem` is sync. `EventSource` callbacks are async.

When a claim doesn't survive fact-check, say so explicitly. Don't just accept the PR body. Phrase: *"PR claims X. Checked against `path/to/file.ts:42` — actually Y. The fix [does/doesn't] address the real cause."*

If the PR's fix is right but the explanation is wrong, that's still a smell — file a follow-up explaining the real cause so future readers don't inherit the wrong mental model.

## Stacked-PR detection

A "stacked PR" is one whose branch was cut from another open PR's branch, not from main. Symptoms:
- `gh pr diff <N>` shows commits/files that belong to another open PR
- `git log origin/main..origin/<branch> --oneline` shows more commits than the PR's "commits" list claims

To verify:
```bash
git fetch origin <branch> && git log origin/main..origin/<branch> --oneline
```

Recovery sequence (do NOT merge the stacked PR first):
1. **Land the parent PR first** (rebase-merge to main)
2. **Rebase the stacked PR onto fresh main**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin && git checkout <stacked-branch> && git rebase origin/main
   ```
   Git auto-drops the parent's commits (cherry-pick equivalence detection).
3. **Force-push**: `git push --force-with-lease`
4. **Flip to ready / monitor CI**

Never merge a stacked PR via `--squash` thinking it'll subsume the parent — you'll lose the parent's PR discussion and history.

## CI not firing

If `gh pr checks <N>` returns "no checks reported," diagnose:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| PR opened by `GITHUB_TOKEN` (Actions bot author) | GitHub anti-recursion: events triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` do NOT create new workflow runs ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow)) | **User account** close+reopen via `gh pr close <N> && gh pr reopen <N>` — actor identity becomes the user, not the bot, so `reopened` fires. (Close+reopen done by the bot itself stays suppressed.) Permanent fix: switch the bot to a GitHub App installation token or PAT. |
| Draft flipped to ready, no checks | Workflow's `pull_request:` trigger doesn't list `ready_for_review` (default types are only `[opened, synchronize, reopened]`) | Fix the workflow: `types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]`. Short-term unblock: close+reopen, or push an empty commit. |
| All PRs cold | Workflow disabled / file syntax error | `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml --jq .state` should return `active` |

### Reading mixed-run CI status

After a force-push, `gh pr checks <N>` lists ALL recent workflow runs' jobs together — including jobs from the previous run that the concurrency rule cancelled mid-flight. A `smoke fail` row from an older `runs/XXXXX` URL is usually a cancelled job whose `needs:` dependency was cancelled, not a real test failure.

To filter to the current run only:

```bash
gh pr view <N> --json statusCheckRollup --jq '.statusCheckRollup
  | group_by(.detailsUrl | capture("runs/(?<id>[0-9]+)").id)
  | map({runId: (.[0].detailsUrl | capture("runs/(?<id>[0-9]+)").id),
         checks: [.[] | {name, status, conclusion}]})'
```

The newest run's `runId` will be the highest number. If all of its jobs show `SUCCESS`, the PR is genuinely green even if older-run rows show `CANCELLED` / `fail`.

**Monitor scripts that aggregate "all pass" can produce false-failure signals from cancelled-run artifacts.** When this happens, manually verify with the `runId` grouping above before assuming the PR is broken.

**A green aggregate is not a green gate — verify the fast jobs completed, not just that the slow ones passed.** The `format` job (Biome, ~seconds) is far faster than `test` / `e2e` (minutes). A monitor whose exit condition is "all jobs non-pending" can fire the instant the *slow* jobs settle green — while `format` either hasn't reported yet or has already failed and scrolled past. This bit us: #705 (2026-08) merged with its `format` job red, landing an unformatted file on **main**, which then failed the `format` gate on *every* subsequent PR until a fix-forward (#713) caught it a session later. Before merging a bot PR, confirm the current run's `format` job specifically shows `SUCCESS` — not just that the run has no pending jobs. A red `format` on main is especially costly because it's silent: nothing re-runs main's CI, so it stays red (and blocks every open PR's `format` check) until someone notices. **If several open PRs all show an identical single-job failure, suspect a red gate on main before suspecting the PRs** — check whether that job fails on a fresh `main` checkout (`npm run format:check`), and if so fix-forward on main (via PR) rather than chasing each PR.

## Recommend merge / close / changes

Before recommending, consider:

- **Is the fix structurally right?** Per rule 18 — patches vs. structural corrections. If the PR's fix is a patch around a deeper bug, push back or file a follow-up.
- **Does it match the project's conventions?** Per the project's CLAUDE.md and `.claude/rules/team-preferences.md`.
- **Does CI catch what matters?** Green CI is necessary but not sufficient — flake-fix PRs especially can pass CI by luck. Per rule 35, flake-fix PRs need `--repeat-each=5` durability proof.
- **Is there a stacked PR?** Don't recommend merging if there's a parent that should land first.

For bot-authored PRs (see "Reading bot-authored PRs" above), also:

- **Does the declared `Mode:` match the diff?** Pure refactors must be `structural`; behavior-changing fixes must be `behavioral` or `mixed`. Agent B already checked this; you're the second pair of eyes.
- **Does the runtime exercise actually prove the fix works?** For `behavioral` / `mixed` modes, the repro path's actual output must match the linked issue's expected behavior.
- **Are `Discovered:` items genuinely adjacent (not incomplete-fix dodges)?** If a discovered item is what the bot should have fixed in-scope, push back instead of accepting + filing follow-up.
- **Are there leftover `tmp-*` files in the diff?** The runtime exercise's scratch should never appear in commits.

## Merge protocol

Default: **always ask before merging**. Even with admin bypass available.

When merging:
- **Rebase-merge only** per rule 16 (`gh pr merge <N> --rebase --delete-branch`)
- Solo maintainer with branch protection requiring 1 review: add `--admin` after explicit user confirmation
- After merge, `git checkout main && git pull --rebase origin main`

Bot-authored PRs (fix-bot, feature-bot) open as **draft** by design. Before merging:
- Verify the bot-PR checks above pass (Mode-vs-diff, runtime-exercise output, no `tmp-*` leakage)
- Mark ready with `gh pr ready <N>` — this triggers any workflows gated on `ready_for_review`
- Wait for CI on the now-ready PR before merging

If two PRs are both green and unrelated:
- Merge sequentially, not batched — keeps blame attribution clean if main breaks
- After first merge, second PR may need rebase; check `gh pr view <N> --json mergeable`

Doc-only PRs (per memory: `*.md`-only diffs by the maintainer) may admin-rebase-merge immediately without CI wait. Bot doc-only PRs still go through CI — the bot's PR-body claims need verification.

## Follow-up issues

Two sources feed this workflow:

1. **PR-driven** — a PR mitigates but doesn't fix the underlying cause; file a follow-up so the real fix doesn't get lost.
2. **Bot-discovered** — a bot-authored PR's `Discovered:` block names adjacent pre-existing bugs the bot observed while exercising its fix. The bot deliberately surfaced these instead of widening scope. Harvest each entry as a candidate follow-up.

For each candidate (either source), decide whether it warrants an issue. Skip if the discovered item is too vague to act on or already covered by an open issue (`gh issue list --search "<term>"` first).

### Routing the new issue (rule 40)

Pick labels by **task shape**, not by the source bot's domain:

- **One-shot** (refactor, hygiene, SOLID/DRY fix, missing-test backfill, small enhancement without a design doc) → `bug + ready-for-agent` → fix-bot picks it up
- **Cut of designed feature** (references a `design-{feature}.md`, depends on other cuts, under a tracking issue) → `enhancement + ready-for-agent` → feature-bot picks it up

Don't default to `flake` — that label is for tests intermittently failing, not for every test-adjacent issue. Apply `flake` only when the discovered behavior actually IS a CI flake.

### Issue body template

```bash
gh issue create --title "..." --label bug,ready-for-agent --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Context
<PR # exercised; the real cause / adjacent finding is below>

## Why this needs a separate fix
<the fact-checked race / behavior / structural gap>

## Recommended fix
<the structurally right approach; cite team-preferences rule if applicable>

## Acceptance criteria
<what the fix must demonstrate>

## Bot disclosure
> *This was generated by AI during PR review.*
EOF
)"
```

**Label hygiene reminder** (gazetta-specific): fix-bot picks up `bug + ready-for-agent`; feature-bot picks up `enhancement + ready-for-agent`. If neither, triage-bot looks first (input is "no classification labels yet"). Don't apply `bug` without `ready-for-agent` — lands the issue in limbo (triage-bot ignores it; fix-bot won't either). Per rule 40, the load-bearing axis is task shape, not the source bot.

## Self-improvement (pass-end)

This skill improves the same way the bots do — by feeding review
outcomes back into the guidance that shapes the next pass — but with
a substrate suited to running locally under human review, not on a
cron. The bots write a `reviewer-log.jsonl`, compact it monthly into
a `lessons-learned.md`, and front-load that file into the next run.
The analog here: **when a pass surfaces a durable insight, propose an
edit to this SKILL.md at pass-end.** SKILL.md *is* the front-loaded
guidance (it's read at the start of every `/review-prs`), and its git
history *is* the raw log — every insight-driven edit is a commit,
auditable and reversible. No separate log file: for prose insights
with no counts to aggregate, the commit history is the durable record
(this is how rules 41/42 landed — a pass discovered the proof-of-work
pruning nuance, it went into SKILL.md, committed).

### What counts as a durable insight

Not every pass produces one — most are "merged N clean PRs, learned
nothing," and those get no edit (absence-as-state, per Krug rule 23).
Propose a SKILL.md edit only when the pass surfaced something that
would change how a *future* pass reviews:

- **A new anti-pattern to catch** (e.g. a bot-PR shape that looked fine
  but wasn't — the mode-vs-diff mismatch class).
- **A refined heuristic** (e.g. rule 41's drift-*probability*-not-
  *possibility* sharpening of proof-of-work pruning).
- **A CI / GitHub gotcha** that cost time and would recur (the kind
  that lands in team-preferences rule 34 — cross-link it here if it's
  review-specific).
- **A fact-check that changed a verdict** — if the PR body's claim was
  wrong in an instructive way, capture the check so the next reviewer
  runs it.

Do NOT propose an edit for: a one-off insight specific to a single PR
that won't recur; a restatement of guidance already in SKILL.md; or a
project-fact that belongs in `team-preferences.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
instead (propose it *there* — route by where the guidance is consumed,
per the same task-shape logic as rule 40).

### How to propose it

1. At pass-end, if a durable insight surfaced, state it plainly and
   name where in SKILL.md it belongs (which section, why).
2. Draft the exact edit (diff-shaped) and surface it for approval —
   **never self-commit a SKILL.md change without the maintainer's ok**
   (same human-gate discipline as every other change; rule 33 —
   branch + PR, no direct-to-main).
3. On approval, land it as a `docs:` change to SKILL.md (branch + PR),
   commit message naming the pass/insight that produced it — so the
   git history stays a legible log of *why* each heuristic exists.

This is the human-review layer's version of the bots' durable-memory
loop: the reviewer that gates every bot PR now also compounds what it
learns, instead of re-deriving heuristics each session and losing them
when the conversation ends.

## Output discipline

- One PR at a time. Don't batch multiple recommendations into one long message.
- State results, not your thought process. "Verdict: merge with caveat X" beats "Let me think about whether to merge..."
- Use the file_path:line_number format for code references so the user can click through.
- When CI is running, use Monitor to track it in background — don't block the conversation.
