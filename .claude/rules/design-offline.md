# Admin offline mode

Foundational dimension #12 of 13. Admin works through transient connectivity loss (server restart, Wi-Fi drop, VPN issue) and degrades gracefully. Read paths serve from a local persistent cache; write paths queue and replay on reconnect; conflict resolution preserves author intent.

**Status**: design pass complete (2026-05). Implementation phases sit in Tier 3.

**Companion docs**:
- [`feature-design-process.md`](feature-design-process.md) — defines the **Offline check** every new feature design must answer
- [`design-cache.md`](design-cache.md) — caching layer; offline mode adds a persistent client-side cache
- [`design-auth-rbac.md`](design-auth-rbac.md) — role-aware cache scope (RBAC); reconnect replay attribution
- [`design-audit.md`](design-audit.md) — audit log records reconnect replay events
- [`design-rendering.md`](design-rendering.md) — preview during offline degrades to last-cached render

## Why this is foundational

Admin offline mode is foundational because:

1. **Every UI surface respects offline state.** Banners, save buttons, picker affordances, dirty-dot semantics, validation surfaces — all need offline awareness. Adding it later means retrofitting every surface.

2. **Multi-foundational interactions.** Offline cache scope must respect role visibility (don't cache pages the user can't see). Reconnect must replay save attempts in audit-log-correct order. Real-time event source feeds offline cache invalidation. Conflict resolution interacts with the team review workflow. None of these compose right without dimension-level design.

3. **It's a quality signal at team CMS scale.** Solo authors tolerate "save failed, retry later"; team workflows hit transient connectivity issues at 100x the rate (commercial Wi-Fi, VPN reconnects, deploy windows). Graceful offline behavior differentiates "professional CMS" from "demo CMS."

4. **Save-pending model already half-supports it.** The current pending-edits model (per the bug #106 fix) keeps content + structural changes in browser memory until explicit save. Offline mode extends this naturally — pending edits become persistent across browser reload, save attempts queue, reconnect replays.

## Locked invariants

### Save semantics: commit intent (online or offline)

**Save means "I'm ready to commit this version."** Online or offline doesn't change that. The system's job is to deliver the commit when it can.

This means save works offline. Author clicks Save → save enters queue → replays on reconnect → conflicts surface per Q3 if applicable.

The alternative (save disabled while offline) was considered and rejected:
- Treats save as "send to server" — too literal
- Disables a familiar action when authors don't expect it disabled
- Forces a "save everything pending" prompt on reconnect (UX friction)
- Surfaces conflicts on next-edit rather than at the moment author committed

Save-as-commit aligns with `design-editor-ux.md`'s pending-edits model: author explicitly commits; system handles delivery.

### Pending edits vs save queue (two distinct concepts)

| Concept | Lifetime | Trigger | Persistence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pending edits** | Per-item; accumulate as author edits; persist across navigation, reload, offline | Author has not yet committed (no save click) | IndexedDB; survives browser close |
| **Save queue** | Per save attempt; replays on reconnect | Author clicked Save while offline | IndexedDB; survives browser close |

**Author flow** is navigation-free:

1. Edit page X → pending edits accumulate on X (not committed)
2. Navigate to page Y → X's pending edits persist; Y loads fresh server state OR own pending if any
3. Edit Y → pending edits on Y
4. Navigate back to X → X's pending edits restored; author resumes
5. Author commits X (clicks Save) → save attempts → succeeds online OR queues offline
6. Save queue handles delivery; pending cleared on save click (becomes save-in-flight or queued state)

**Author isn't forced to save.** Author can navigate between pages with unsaved pending edits across many pages. Pending edits never silently apply or auto-save. Each save is an explicit commit by the author.

**No auto-save on connection loss.** If author goes offline mid-edit, pending stays in pending state. The author chose not to commit yet; system doesn't override that choice.

**Author can save partial work.** Save commits whatever is in pending at save click time. Author can keep editing after; new pending accumulates; saves when they want.

### Other locked invariants

- **Pending edits persist across browser reload.** The existing pending-edits Pinia stores (`editorContent`, `editorStash`, `editorStructural`) hydrate from IndexedDB on admin boot.
- **Read paths degrade to last-cached.** When the server is unreachable, `/api/pages`, `/api/fragments`, `/api/assets` etc. return cached results with a staleness indicator. Cache backed by `AdminCache` with `IndexedDBCache` provider — extends the cache provider taxonomy.
- **Save queue replays on reconnect.** Save / publish attempts that happened while offline are queued separately from pending edits; replayed on reconnect in submission order. Conflict on replay surfaces per Q3.
- **Cache scope respects RBAC.** Cached entries are scoped to the role principal at cache time; switching role / re-auth invalidates the cache. Don't leak data across role switches.
- **Audit log on reconnect.** Replay events go to audit log with `replayed: true` + original-attempt timestamp. Operators see the offline activity later.

## Persistence layer (Q1 locked)

UX-driven choice: **IndexedDB primary; MemoryCache fallback when IndexedDB unavailable.** localStorage rejected.

### UX requirements driving the choice

1. **Author opens admin → sees their work immediately** (cached state renders instantly)
2. **Edits during connection blip → no interruption** (save/validate/preview work)
3. **Pending edits survive reload/crash** (rules out MemoryCache as primary)
4. **Save during typing without UI freeze** (rules out localStorage's sync API)
5. **Cross-tab sync** (BroadcastChannel)
6. **Invisible reconnect** (no buttons; transparent)
7. **Conflict UX is clear and kind** (force-save banner; not silent overwrite — see Q3)
8. **Storage limit hit gracefully degrades** (rules out localStorage's tight 5MB cap)

### Persistence layers

| Provider | When used | UX posture |
|---|---|---|
| **`IndexedDBCache`** | Default; whenever IndexedDB is available | Best UX; meets all 8 requirements |
| **`MemoryCache` (browser-side)** | Fallback when IndexedDB unavailable (private browsing mostly) | Banner: "Offline persistence unavailable in private browsing — your edits will be lost on reload." Honest degradation. |

**localStorage rejected**: sync API freezes UI on writes (5-50ms per save — hostile at typing rate); 5MB cap structurally too tight for envelope sites; would force eviction at much smaller scale than IndexedDB; sneaky persistence promise — would pretend to offer durable storage that gets evicted under pressure.

**Reserved for v2** (when concrete demand surfaces):
- `OPFSCache` — when site exceeds IndexedDB quota OR when worker-thread sync writes are needed
- `LocalStorageCache` — only if a real use case demands persistence WITHOUT IndexedDB AND without UI-freeze concerns

### Provider selection logic (boot)

```ts
async function selectBrowserCacheProvider(): Promise<AdminCache> {
  if (await indexedDBProbe()) {
    return new IndexedDBCache({ siteName, quotaTarget })
  }
  // IndexedDB unavailable — show banner; offline mode degrades to in-memory only
  showOfflinePersistenceWarning()
  return new MemoryCache(/* per-instance memory; no persistence */)
}
```

`indexedDBProbe()` opens a real test transaction (catches private-mode-throws-on-use; some browsers report IndexedDB available but throw on use).

### Storage isolation

- Per-site key prefix matches `design-cache.md` Gap 3 lock — `IndexedDBCache` auto-prefixes keys with site name internally. Multi-site projects share IndexedDB without collision.
- Cross-tab sync via native **BroadcastChannel** — invalidations broadcast to peer tabs in same origin. No library needed.

### `navigator.storage.persist()` opt-in

```ts
admin: {
  offline: {
    enabled: true,
    requestPersistence: true,  // calls navigator.storage.persist() at boot
  },
}
```

User browser may grant or deny persistence based on heuristics (bookmarked, frequently used). Granting promotes IndexedDB from "best-effort" (can be cleared by browser under storage pressure) to "won't be cleared without user action." UX-positive — reduces accidental data loss.

### npm stack

The recommended dependencies for implementation:

| Concern | Library | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **IndexedDB wrapper** | `idb` (^8.0.0) by Jake Archibald | Implements `IndexedDBCache` provider; ~2KB; promise-based; industry-standard |
| **Query/mutation cache + offline queue** | `@tanstack/vue-query` | Manages client-side query state + offline mutation queue + optimistic updates |
| **Cross-tab sync** | Native `BroadcastChannel` | No library; just the API |
| **Connection detection** | `@tanstack/vue-query` built-in + `navigator.onLine` | No additional library; Vue Query already handles this |
| **Persistence to L6** | `@tanstack/query-async-storage-persister` + custom `idb` adapter | Bridges Vue Query cache to `IndexedDBCache` |

**Why Vue Query**: Gazetta admin is Vue 3 + Pinia. Vue Query (`@tanstack/vue-query`) provides mature primitives for offline UX:
- Query/mutation cache with rehydration
- Optimistic updates (`useMutation({ onMutate, onError, onSettled })`)
- Offline mutation queue with replay
- Online/offline detection with extension points
- ~13K stars; ~1M weekly downloads

**Why two complementary cache layers** (Vue Query + L6 IndexedDBCache):
- **Vue Query**: client-side query state lifecycle (loading/error/data; mutations)
- **L6 `IndexedDBCache`**: persistent storage of last-known data
- Vue Query rehydrates from L6 at boot via `persistQueryClient` plugin

**Rejected v1 dependencies**:
- **Service Worker / Workbox** — reserved for v2 PWA installation per Future directions; v1 admin works in regular tab without service worker
- **Yjs / Automerge / Loro** (CRDTs) — concurrent editing is Tier 3; v1 conflict resolution is force-save with banner (Q3)
- **localForage** — older library; doesn't add value over `idb` for our use case

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Server-side AdminCache and client-side AdminCache share the interface but operate independently.** The server caches for hot-path reads; the client caches for offline tolerance. They're coordinated via SSE invalidation events — when the server invalidates `pages:`, it broadcasts to connected clients to invalidate their browser caches (per `design-cache.md`'s offline composition section).

### Service worker for app-shell caching (v1)

**Service worker ships in v1, scoped to app-shell caching only.** Solves "open admin offline → blank screen" definitively.

**What v1 SW does**:
- Precaches admin SPA bundle (HTML/JS/CSS) via `vite-plugin-pwa`
- Cold-load admin offline → SW serves cached shell → IndexedDBCache hydrates state → admin renders
- Update flow: `skipWaiting` + `clientsClaim` with toast notification ("New version available — refresh to update")

**What v1 SW does NOT do**:
- **Background sync** (`BackgroundSyncPlugin`) — deferred to v2. Replay-with-tab-closed is low marginal value for CMS work. Authors reopen admin to check sync status; replay-on-next-open is acceptable UX.
- **PWA install prompt** (`manifest.json` install) — deferred to v2 as operator opt-in feature
- **Push notifications** — deferred; will compose with collaboration design pass

**Dependency**: `vite-plugin-pwa` (^0.20.x). Built on Workbox; declarative configuration; well-maintained.

**Why service worker in v1**: cold-load reliability. Without SW, browser HTTP cache may have evicted the SPA bundle by the time the user opens admin offline; "site can't be reached" failure mode. With SW, SPA bundle is intentionally cached and survives. Aligns with PWA-style responsiveness principle from `design-cache.md`.

**Update detection UX** (handled by vite-plugin-pwa):
- New SW version detected → toast "New admin version available"
- Author clicks "Refresh" → smooth reload with new version
- Skipping toast → next page navigation activates new version

**HTTPS requirement**: service workers require HTTPS in production. Localhost development works on HTTP. Already a Gazetta requirement for auth cookies; no new constraint.

## Connection detection (Q2 locked)

Hybrid: `navigator.onLine` for instant UI signal + heartbeat to confirm/correct.

**Why hybrid**: `navigator.onLine` is unreliable (browsers sometimes report online when network is broken; or report offline when network is fine). Pure heartbeat is accurate but lagged + costly. Hybrid uses each for what it's best at.

**Heartbeat cadence** — on-demand, not constant:

| State | Heartbeat behavior |
|---|---|
| `online` (recent successful request) | No heartbeat; quiet |
| `degraded` (`navigator.onLine` false OR failed request) | Heartbeat every 5s |
| `offline` (heartbeat failed N times) | Backoff to every 30s |
| `reconnecting` (heartbeat succeeded after offline) | Trigger queue replay; transition to `online` |

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/health` returning `{ ok: true, timestamp }`. Lightweight (no DB query, no auth check); public; cacheable at edge for `dynamic` targets with worker.

**Connection state model**: five states surfaced via Pinia store `useConnectionState`:

| State | UI |
|---|---|
| `online` | No banner; normal UI |
| `degraded` | Subtle indicator ("Connection unstable"); appears after 1 failure; clears on success |
| `offline` | Persistent banner ("Offline — your edits are queued") with status pulse |
| `reconnecting` | Banner ("Syncing your edits...") with progress; clears when queue empty |

**Vue Query integration**:

```ts
import { onlineManager } from '@tanstack/vue-query'

connectionState.$subscribe((mutation, state) => {
  onlineManager.setOnline(state.status === 'online' || state.status === 'reconnecting')
})
```

When Vue Query is "offline," queries pause (don't refetch); mutations queue; on `setOnline(true)`, mutations replay automatically.

**No "work offline" toggle** for users. Authors don't want to "go offline"; offline is what happens TO them. Browser DevTools is the override for developers testing offline behavior.

**Cold-start offline**: SW serves cached admin shell → IndexedDBCache hydrates state → render UI populated → connection state immediately `offline` with banner → pending edits work; queue accumulates → on reconnect, replay invisible. No "waiting for connection" screen.

## Conflict resolution (Q3 locked)

**v1: force-save with diff banner.** Three-way merge reserved for v2.

### The conflict scenario

1. Author A starts editing page X at T0 (server version hash = X1)
2. Author A goes offline at T1 (still editing)
3. Author B online edits + saves page X at T2 (T0 < T1 < T2; new server hash A1)
4. Author A reconnects at T3 with pending save (its `If-Match` is X1)
5. Server's current is A1; A's save is stale

### Detection mechanism

- Reads return `etag: <content-hash>` header (existing `.{8hex}.hash` per `sidecars.md`)
- Client stores the etag with the cached state
- Saves include `If-Match: <hash>` header
- Server compares incoming `If-Match` to current hash; on mismatch, returns `409 STALE`:

```ts
{
  code: 'STALE',
  currentVersion: { /* manifest */ },
  currentVersionAuthor: { id, email, role },
  currentVersionAt: '2026-05-04T...'
}
```

### UX: surface conflict, no force-overwrite

When client receives `409 STALE`, surfaces a banner with two actions:

| Action | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **"Show what changed"** | Opens diff view: server's current vs. author's pending; field-by-field semantic diff |
| **"Discard my changes"** | Drops pending save; reloads server's current version |

**No "Save anyway (overwrite)" button.** Authors who genuinely want to overwrite specific changes manually port their edits onto the new version (load the diff, decide what to keep, save the merged result as a fresh edit).

This matches Linear / Notion / Figma — no force-overwrite button. Author chooses to layer their changes onto the new state, not silently overwrite. Removes a footgun (accidental overwrites of colleague's work) and simplifies the conflict UX.

### Diff view

**Field-by-field semantic diff** (v1):
- "Title: 'Welcome' → 'Hello' (yours) vs. 'Greetings' (theirs: bob@example.com, 5 min ago)"
- Maps manifest fields to human-readable labels
- Highlights conflicting fields (both you and they changed) vs. clean overlays (only one of you changed)

**JSON diff** (rejected for v1): too technical for authors.
**Visual diff (side-by-side rendered preview)** (rejected for v1): heavy implementation; v2 if demand surfaces.

### Multi-write replay

Author saves 5 times offline then reconnects:

```
T0: page hash X1
T1 offline: save A1 (If-Match: X1) → queue
T2 offline: save A2 (If-Match: A1's projected hash) → queue
T3 reconnect: replay A1 → succeeds; new server hash A1
T4: replay A2 → If-Match matches projected → succeeds
```

**Client tracks pending edit sequence with chained hash projections.** Each pending edit's `If-Match` is the previous edit's projected resulting hash. Server applies in order.

If A1 conflicts (because B saved between A's start and reconnect):
- Conflict UI surfaces ONCE at A1
- A2-A5 paused until A resolves A1
- After A resolves A1 (overwrite OR discard), A2-A5 replay against the new sequence (may surface their own conflicts in turn)

### Publish event conflicts

Same pattern: publish events also include `If-Match: <target-state-hash>`; server returns `409 STALE` on mismatch with publish-target-specific metadata. UX banner adapts: "another author published this target while you were offline."

### v2: three-way merge

Reserved when concurrent editing demand materializes (Tier 3 strategic bet — OT/CRDT). Three-way merge for structured content (manifest JSON) is solvable but complex:
- Text-field merge (article body, descriptions): well-understood via OT/CRDT
- Structural-change merge (component reordering): semantics unclear in conflict cases
- Implementation cost high; debugging cost higher
- v1 doesn't need it; v2 may

## Cache freshness UI (Q4 locked)

Three layers of staleness UI:

### Global banner (locked in Q2)

Connection state via `useConnectionState` Pinia store drives global banner:

| State | Banner |
|---|---|
| `online` | Hidden |
| `degraded` | Subtle "Connection unstable" |
| `offline` | Persistent "Offline — your edits are queued" |
| `reconnecting` | "Syncing N edits..." with progress |

### Per-item "last synced" timestamp

In editor metadata panel, small neutral text:

- **Online + recent**: hidden (don't clutter when fresh)
- **Offline OR last sync > 5 min ago**: "Last synced X min ago"
- **Offline + viewing cached content from previous session**: "Last synced X hours ago"

Threshold (5 min) tunable; goal is to surface staleness only when meaningful.

### Sync-state visibility (Krug-aligned: "Don't Make Me Think")

Authors should know whether work is on the server **without thinking about it**. Visual indicators only when something is NOT synced or NEEDS attention. The absence of an indicator IS the synced state.

**State categories from the author's perspective**:

| Category | What author thinks | UI |
|---|---|---|
| **Fine** | "All good" (no conscious thought) | No indicator |
| **Working** | "I'm editing this" | Dirty dot (existing pattern) |
| **Saving** | "Saving now" | Spinner during save click |
| **Saved locally** | "It's saved; will sync later" | Cloud-with-slash icon |
| **Needs attention** | "I need to fix this" | Red badge + clear message |

Five categories, three of them transient or conditional. Steady state is "no indicator" (synced) or "dirty dot" (in progress).

### Save button — same online and offline

Save button language is identical regardless of connection state. Author's mental model: "I click Save; it says saved." Same button, same flow.

| State | Save button | What changes is WHERE saved |
|---|---|---|
| Clean | Disabled | Nothing to do |
| Pending edits | Enabled "Save" | Click commits |
| Saving (in-flight) | Disabled, spinner | Brief |
| Just saved (online) | "Saved" feedback fades → clean state | No indicator |
| Just saved (offline) | "Saved" feedback fades → cloud-with-slash icon | Author sees: saved locally |

Author always sees "Saved" feedback after click. The DIFFERENCE shows up after the feedback fades — clean state online, cloud-with-slash icon offline. Same mental model both ways. The icon tells them WHERE.

### Per-item indicators — only when noteworthy

Site tree + editor metadata show per-item indicators ONLY when something is interesting:

| Condition | Site tree | Editor metadata |
|---|---|---|
| Synced and clean | (nothing) | (nothing) |
| Pending edits | Dirty dot | Dirty dot in toolbar |
| Saved locally only | Cloud-with-slash icon | "Saved locally — will send when online" |
| Conflict | Red badge | Red banner with clear message |
| Created offline (never synced) | Cloud-with-slash icon (treated same as "saved locally") | "Saved locally — will send when online" |

No "Last synced: 2 min ago" timestamps in normal operation. That's noise — the author doesn't care about precision when everything is fine. Hover the cloud icon for tooltip ("Saved locally at 10:23 — waiting to send") if author wants the detail.

### Global indicator — minimal

Top bar / banner shows minimal status:

| Connection state | Indicator |
|---|---|
| Online + everything synced | Nothing |
| Online + replaying (just reconnected) | Subtle spinner with "Sending your saved items..." (transient) |
| Offline | Banner: "Offline" (plain word; no jargon) |
| Sync had failures | Notification toast: "1 item couldn't send — review →" |

The banner is just "Offline" — not "Offline — N items queued." If author wants the count, they glance at the site tree (cloud icons on items waiting). The banner stays minimal; detail is in the tree.

### Plain language (no jargon)

| Technical term | Author-facing language |
|---|---|
| "Queued" | "Saved locally" / "Will send when online" |
| "Sync" | "Send to server" (when explained); icon usually |
| "Conflict" | "Was edited by someone else" |
| "STALE" / "If-Match" / "replay queue" | (never shown to author) |

Authors think in their own terms. The system's internal terminology stays internal.

### Late conflict surfaces

If author saved offline at 10am, reconnects at 2pm, save replays and conflicts:

- **Notification toast**: "Page Home was edited by someone else while you were offline — review →"
- Click → opens the page; conflict banner shows what changed (per Q3 lock)
- Plain-language message; no "STALE conflict" jargon

If author isn't currently in admin (closed tab): visible on next admin open as a notification at top.

### Force-sync affordance (visible only when relevant)

When items are saved-locally, the offline banner has a "Send now" link:
- Triggers heartbeat probe + replay sequence
- Useful when author knows network is back; system is still backing off
- Affordance only present when there's something to send; hidden otherwise

Per-item retry: when an item failed to sync (conflict / error), the editor has a "Try again" affordance after author resolves.

### What's REMOVED from earlier lock

- ❌ **"Queued" badge text** — replaced by universal cloud-with-slash icon (no jargon)
- ❌ **Persistent "Saved ✓" indicator after save** — fades; absence is the synced state
- ❌ **Numeric progress in banner** ("Syncing 3 of 15") — reduces to a subtle spinner; site tree shows per-item progress; numbers are noise
- ❌ **Tab title status** — `(3 syncing) Admin` is noise; tab titles identify tabs, not state
- ❌ **First-time-user help tooltip** — if UI needs explaining, fix the UI; cloud icon is universal enough
- ❌ **"Last synced: X min ago" timestamps in editor metadata** — noise during normal operation; tooltip on hover when author wants detail
- ❌ **"N items with pending edits" + "M items waiting to sync" separate counts** — site tree shows it; top bar stays minimal

### Accessibility (kept from prior lock)

Visual language uses text labels alongside color where text is shown ("Try again" button has both icon and text). Cloud-with-slash icon has aria-label "Saved locally, waiting to send." Screen reader announces state transitions. RTL inheritance from admin root.

### Save semantics with sync visibility

- User clicks "Save" → save attempted
- **If online**: in-flight → server responds → either synced (success state, brief "✓") or failed (banner)
- **If offline**: save enters queue → button shows "Queued" → on reconnect, replay attempts; success → synced, conflict → failed surface

Author always knows whether their commit reached the server.

### Mid-save connection-loss (handled invisibly)

Author clicks Save online → connection drops before server responds. Two cases:
- **Server received but response lost**: client retries with same content-hash (`If-Match`); server-side idempotency returns success; item transitions to clean.
- **Server didn't receive**: save automatically transitions from in-flight to saved-locally; sends on reconnect.

Either way, the author sees the cloud-with-slash icon if the save didn't confirm; clean state if it did. No silent loss. No technical jargon surfaces.

### Storage approaching limit

When local storage approaches the cap (80% of allocated), a subtle banner surfaces: "Storage almost full — please connect to send your saved items." Plain language; actionable; appears once until acknowledged or storage frees.

LRU eviction kicks in only at 100% (per `design-cache.md` Gap 1 lock). The 80% warning gives the author buffer to act.

### Replay progress UI

When reconnecting with a queue:

| Queue state | UI |
|---|---|
| Replay starts | Banner: "Syncing N edits..." |
| Replay progresses | Banner updates: "Syncing M of N edits..." |
| All succeed | Banner clears; toast: "N edits synced" (auto-dismiss 3s) |
| Some conflicts | Banner: "M of N edits had conflicts. Review them →" |

### Conflict banner (per-page, distinct from global offline banner)

When 409 STALE surfaces (per Q3), conflict banner appears at top of affected page editor:
- Visual distinction: red/warning vs. blue/info global banner
- Coexists with offline banner (global + per-page conflict)
- Three actions per Q3 lock: Show diff / Save anyway / Discard

### Asset upload pending badges

Author drops files while offline:
- Files queued with "pending sync" badge
- Asset library shows pending state (different visual)
- Reconnect triggers upload replay; badges clear as uploads complete

### Rejected v1 UX

- **Per-item visual freshness icons** (green/yellow/red dots): over-engineered; global state is enough; adds noise to every item view
- **JSON diff in conflict view**: too technical for authors (per Q3 lock)
- **Visual side-by-side preview diff**: heavy implementation; v2 if demand surfaces

## Audit log shape for offline replays (Q5 locked)

Per `design-audit.md`'s Foundational checks: replayed events record `metadata.replayed: true` + original-attempt timestamp; actor captured at queue time, not replay time.

**Granularity**: single audit event per replayed save (NOT batch). Preserves chronology — operators see each edit as a discrete event with its own queued-at and replayed-at timestamps. Matches multi-write replay model (Q3 lock).

**Replay metadata fields** on every replayed save event:

```ts
{
  action: 'save' | 'publish' | 'delete' | ...,
  outcome: 'success' | 'failed-render' | 'forbidden' | 'validation-failed',
  actor: { /* captured at queue time, not replay time */ },
  scope: { /* item being saved */ },
  // Replay metadata
  metadata: {
    replayed: true,
    queuedAt: '2026-05-04T14:23:05.123Z',       // browser-local time at queue time
    replayedAt: '2026-05-04T14:30:00.456Z',     // server-side replay time (= event timestamp)
    requestId: 'replay-...',
    // For failed replays:
    failureReason?: 'stale' | 'forbidden' | 'validation-failed',
    // For STALE conflicts:
    conflictWith?: { actor: { id, email }, at: '2026-05-04T14:25:00Z' },
  }
}
```

**Failed replay audit**: full failure context + replay metadata. STALE conflicts additionally record `conflictWith` (the in-the-meantime save's actor + timestamp) — operators can reconstruct the sequence.

**`queuedAt` source**: browser-local time at queue time. Captures author's intent ("I tried to save at this moment"). Clock drift is acceptable for forensic context — most users have NTP-synced clocks; small drift bounded.

**Cancelled-before-replay edits**: NOT audited. Edit removed from L6 queue; no server roundtrip; audit captures only events that reached the server. v1 doesn't audit client-side cancellations; deferred to v2 if regulated-context demand surfaces.

**Conflict resolution actions** (Show diff / Discard from Q3 banner): "Discard" produces no audit event (no server roundtrip). Manual re-edit after viewing diff produces a new save event with `outcome: 'success'` against the current state — normal save audit; no special "merged" event type needed.

## Always-on (Q6 locked)

**Offline UX is structural, not configurable.** No opt-out. Cache + queue + sync IS the admin; not a feature on top.

### Why always-on

- Simpler implementation: no conditional code paths for "offline disabled"
- Aligns with modern collaborative tools (Linear, Notion, Figma, Sanity) — none expose an "offline disable" toggle
- Operators can't accidentally degrade UX for their authors
- Eliminates a category of operator config decisions

### Optional config

```ts
admin: {
  offline: {
    requestPersistence: false,        // opt-in for navigator.storage.persist()
  },
}
```

The only config knob is `requestPersistence` (calls `navigator.storage.persist()` to upgrade IndexedDB from "best-effort" to "won't be cleared without user action"). Default off because granting depends on browser heuristics; operator opts in when they want to request it.

### What happens when IndexedDB is unavailable

Per Q1: `MemoryCache` fallback with banner — "Offline persistence unavailable in private browsing — your edits will be lost on reload." Honest degradation. Vue Query still operates in-memory; admin remains functional.

This isn't an "opt-out" path — it's a graceful degradation when the browser environment doesn't support persistence.

### Bundle cost

| Dependency | Size |
|---|---|
| `idb` | ~2KB |
| `@tanstack/vue-query` | ~30KB |
| `vite-plugin-pwa`-generated service worker (Workbox runtime) | ~50KB |
| **Total offline UX overhead** | ~80-100KB minified |

Acceptable for admin SPA at typical scale (PrimeVue + Vue 3 base is ~200KB+; the offline addition is ~40-50% of base).

### Migration

Existing sites: offline UX activates on upgrade. Authors observe positive behavior change ("my work didn't disappear when I closed the laptop"). Operators didn't need to opt in.

### Positive surprise design

Authors discovering offline UX via use:
- First-time offline (Wi-Fi blip during edit) — banner appears, edits queue, reconnect syncs invisibly. Author thinks "oh nice, it just worked."
- First-time browser-reopen with pending edits — admin loads with their work intact. Author thinks "I didn't lose anything."

No tutorials needed; the feature reveals itself naturally during normal use.

## Foundational checks

How offline composes with each of the other 12 foundational dimensions plus the multi-instance discipline.

### Multi-instance discipline
- Browser-side cache is per-browser-tab (IndexedDB scoped to origin + browser session). Two tabs on the same browser share IndexedDB; two browsers don't. No cross-instance coordination needed at the browser layer.
- Reconnect-replay queue is per-browser. Two browsers each replay their own queue independently — server's `If-Match` chain catches stale replays per Q3.
- Server-side: offline features don't require server changes beyond the existing SSE infrastructure (already per-instance) which broadcasts cache invalidations to connected clients.
- Cross-tab same-browser sync via native `BroadcastChannel`; no cross-instance coordination required.
- Per-site key prefix in IndexedDB matches `design-cache.md` Gap 3 lock — multi-site projects share IndexedDB without collision.

### Scale (#1)
- Cache size budget at envelope (~5000 pages × 150 bytes/summary = ~750KB) is well under IndexedDB quota (50MB+).
- LRU eviction in `IndexedDBCache` matches `design-cache.md` Gap 1 lock when cap is reached.
- Replay queue size: typical offline session has 1-10 pending edits; queue stays small.
- Long offline sessions (hours/days) accumulate larger queues but stay bounded by IndexedDB quota.

### Locale (#2) + Themes (#3)
- L6 cache keys include locale + theme dimensions per `design-cache.md` Q1 lock.
- Theme switch invalidates per-theme entries via prefix invalidation.
- Locale switch invalidates per-locale entries.

### Auth + RBAC (#4)
- Cache scoped to role principal at cache time; switching role / re-auth invalidates the L6 cache.
- Per `design-auth-rbac.md` Foundational checks: "Browser-side cache scoped to role principal; role switch invalidates."
- Replayed write events on reconnect record the actor at queue time, not replay time. If actor lost capability while offline, replay fails with `outcome: 'forbidden'` recorded.
- Trust mode determines auth headers on replay (e.g., Cloudflare Access JWT may have expired during offline; replay fails with `outcome: 'unauthenticated'` → user re-auths → resumes).

### Audit (#5)
- Replayed events record `metadata.replayed: true` + `queuedAt` + `replayedAt` (per Q5 lock).
- Single audit event per replayed save (not batch); preserves chronology.
- Failed replays record full failure context including `failureReason` and (for STALE conflicts) `conflictWith`.
- Cancelled-before-replay edits not audited (never reached server).

### Review (#6)
- Pending edits in offline queue can include review-state transitions (submit-for-review, approve, reject).
- Replay applies the standard state-machine guards: capability check at replay time; conflict on replay if state changed in the meantime.
- `If-Match` chain works on review-state hashes too (each transition produces a new hash).

### Hooks (#7)
- Hook firings during offline queue with the save; replayed on reconnect alongside the save.
- Hook handlers run on the receiving instance during replay (not on the offline browser).
- Audit `action: 'hook-fired'` events emitted during replay carry `metadata.replayed: true` for forensics.

### Render (#8)
- Preview during offline serves last-cached rendered HTML from L6 (per `design-rendering.md` Foundational checks: "offline admin previews from last-cached render").
- Iframe shows staleness banner when serving stale render.
- Dynamic fragments (per `design-rendering.md`): offline preview can't fetch from origin; staleness fallback applies.
- Render-for-analysis (validation Cut 3) runs locally during offline (validators are pure functions over manifests + pre-rendered fragments per `design-validation.md` Foundational checks).

### Validation (#9)
- Save-delta validation runs locally during offline (validators are pure functions over manifests; no server roundtrip required).
- Errors surface in standard banner; offline-specific staleness banner coexists.
- Background scanner pauses while offline; resumes on reconnect with incremental rescan.

### Plugin (#10)
- Plugins inherit offline behavior of their host surface — a plugin-supplied hook composes with offline replay; plugin-supplied storage providers must be offline-aware OR documented as online-only.
- Plugin-supplied cache providers register via `api.registerCacheProvider(name, factory)` per `design-plugins.md` Q3; browser-side providers (`IndexedDBCache`, future `OPFSCache`) follow the same registration pattern.

### Cache (#11)
- L4 + L6 share `AdminCache` interface; coordinate independently via SSE invalidation cascade (per `design-cache.md` offline composition section).
- Cached values must be JSON-serializable (per `design-cache.md` Q3 lock); enforces L6 persistence compatibility.
- `subscribe()` mechanism: L6 providers subscribe to server SSE events; invalidate browser entries on server-driven cache changes.
- Browser-side providers extend cache provider taxonomy; same interface, different lifetime / coordination story.

### Collaboration (#13)
- Comments / mentions / notifications composed during offline: queued as edits; replayed on reconnect.
- Notification delivery during offline window: server-side notifications (e.g., "Bob mentioned you in a comment") accumulate; visible on next reconnect.
- Real-time presence / live cursors (Tier 3 future): out of v1; offline-aware presence deferred.

### Site config (`design-config.md`)
- Per-site `admin.offline` config drives behavior per site
- Default-on per Q6 lock; explicit opt-out via `admin.offline.enabled: false`
- Multi-site projects: each site's offline behavior independent

## Migration

Sites without offline mode configured continue to work — pending edits stay in-memory only (current behavior); save fails surface as toast. Operators opt in via `site.config.ts` `admin.offline.enabled: true`.

Existing pending-edits state in Pinia stores migrates to persistent storage when offline mode is enabled — first save queue / cache write triggers IndexedDB initialization; subsequent reads/writes go through persistent layer.

## Future directions

**Multi-author offline collaboration.** Two authors offline on the same content; reconnect produces conflict that's not just save-vs-save but author-vs-author. Composes with concurrent editing (Tier 3 OT/CRDT bet) — out of v1.

**Offline-first PWA installation.** Admin SPA as installable PWA (`manifest.json` + service worker). Standalone window, app-shell pattern. Out of v1; opt-in feature for operators.

**Selective offline cache (per-section).** Operators choose which content to keep offline (e.g., "all blog pages" but not "all marketing assets"). Storage budget management. Out of v1.

**Background sync with deferred replay.** Service Worker `background-sync` API replays the queue even after the tab closes. Browser-dependent; v2 enhancement when modern browsers fully support it.
