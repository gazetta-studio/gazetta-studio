# Audit log

Foundational dimension #5 of 12. Pluggable audit-event recording with multiple provider implementations (history-extended at v1; external sinks reserved). Composes with auth/RBAC's `Principal` for actor identity and with the real-time event-source discipline (audit log = source of real-time events for presence + live publish status).

**Status**: design pass complete (2026-05). Implementation phases sit in Tier 3.

**Companion docs**:
- [`feature-design-process.md`](feature-design-process.md) — defines the **Audit check** every new feature design must answer
- [`design-auth-rbac.md`](design-auth-rbac.md) — auth/RBAC primitives expose the `Principal` to handlers; audit records actions taken with it
- [`design-publishing.md`](design-publishing.md) — history-recorder is the existing primitive that audit extends
- [`design-plugins.md`](design-plugins.md) — Universal Provider requirements apply to `AuditProvider`
- [`docs/adr/0004-pluggable-provider-pattern.md`](../../docs/adr/0004-pluggable-provider-pattern.md) — pluggable provider pattern

## Why this is foundational

Every write event (save, publish, delete, restore) needs to be recorded with an actor identity, a timestamp, and a target scope. Audit log is the durable record that:
- Compliance auditors trace
- Real-time presence + publish-status observe (per the real-time event-source discipline)
- Forensic incident response queries

Adding audit later means auditing every save/publish/delete consumer and adding actor-recording infrastructure. Joint design with auth/RBAC because audit records actor identity (which RBAC owns) and actions taken (which the capability vocabulary defines).

## Locked invariants (already decided)

- **`AuditProvider` is Extension Surface #11.** Per [`docs/adr/0004-pluggable-provider-pattern.md`](../../docs/adr/0004-pluggable-provider-pattern.md). Universal Provider requirements per [`design-plugins.md`](design-plugins.md) "Universal Provider requirements."
- **history-recorder is the foundation for audit log.** `recordWrite()` already runs on every save and publish ([packages/gazetta/src/history-recorder.ts](../../packages/gazetta/src/history-recorder.ts)). The audit log adds an `actor` field; doesn't replace the existing primitive.
- **Audit log is the source of real-time events.** Per the real-time event-source discipline in `feature-design-process.md`, save/publish handlers record to audit log; real-time push (presence, live publish status) observes audit log. Not bolted into save/publish handlers directly. Real-time consumers filter by `outcome === 'success'` when they only want state changes.
- **Audit and history are conceptually peer surfaces.** v1 ships them unified in `HistoryAuditProvider` (writes a revision on success; writes an audit event on every outcome). v2 separates them — operators wanting "audit to CloudWatch but history stays local" get a clean split. The `AuditProvider` interface is independent of `HistoryProvider`; `HistoryAuditProvider` implements both because they share storage in v1.
- **Outcome is required on every event.** No implicit "default to success" — recording sites supply outcome explicitly. Cuts a class of "I forgot to record the failure" bugs.
- **Actor is a snapshot, not a live reference.** The recorded `actor.role` reflects the role at decision time. Subsequent role changes don't rewrite history. Capabilities are NOT embedded per event — they derive from role + the site.yaml revision active at the event's timestamp (recoverable via history). Group claims are NOT embedded — privacy isolation; correlate with upstream auth logs when needed.

## Surface-specific contract

```ts
export interface AuditProvider {
  readonly name: string
  /** Record an audit event. MUST NOT throw on transport errors;
   *  fall back to local recording on failure. Audit failures never block writes
   *  (fail-open default; strict mode opt-in via admin.audit.strict: true). */
  record(event: AuditEvent): Promise<void>
  /** Optional — providers that own queryable storage implement this.
   *  External-sink providers that push events elsewhere omit it. */
  query?(filter: AuditQuery): Promise<AuditEvent[]>
  /** Optional — providers that push to an external destination return
   *  a deep-link to the operator's destination console.
   *  Returning null means "configured but no link available."
   *  Providers that own queryable storage typically omit this. */
  queryUrl?(): string | null
}
```

**Event shape:**

```ts
export interface AuditEvent {
  /** ISO 8601 with Z suffix; matches existing history-recorder convention. */
  timestamp: string
  /** Snapshot of the principal at decision time — not a live reference.
   *  Roles change; events preserve what was authorized when the action ran. */
  actor: {
    /** Upstream stable subject (OIDC `sub`, OAuth subject, Cloudflare Access
     *  identity_nonce, etc.) — NOT email. Email rotates; sub is stable.
     *  When `admin.audit.actorPseudonym: 'sha256'` is configured, this field
     *  is `sha256(sub + GAZETTA_AUDIT_ACTOR_SALT).slice(0, 16)`.
     *  'unknown' for pre-RBAC revisions or trust:none deployments. */
    id: string
    /** Optional human-readable. Only when the auth provider exposes it.
     *  Redacted to undefined when pseudonymization is enabled
     *  (low-entropy email gives weak pseudonymization; we drop it). */
    email?: string
    /** Resolved Gazetta role at decision time. Snapshot, not a live reference. */
    role: string
    /** Trust mode that produced this principal:
     *  'none' | 'forwarded-user' | 'cloudflare-access' | 'azure-easy-auth' |
     *  'aws-cognito' | 'tailscale' | future plugin-supplied modes. */
    trustMode: string
  }
  /** Narrowed enum; configure-roles records role-mapping changes
   *  in site.yaml as a special "configuration write". */
  action: 'save' | 'publish' | 'delete' | 'restore' | 'configure-roles'
  /** Required. Each recording site supplies its own outcome explicitly —
   *  no implicit default. Closed enum; future ambient-log additions
   *  ('rate-limited', 'session-expired') stay closed-enum. */
  outcome: 'success' | 'forbidden' | 'validation-failed' | 'unauthenticated'
  /** What was acted on. */
  scope: { kind: 'page' | 'fragment' | 'asset' | 'site'; name?: string }
  /** Optional, instance-configurable per privacy / GDPR. Default off. */
  sourceIp?: string
  /** Optional, instance-configurable. Default off. */
  userAgent?: string
  /** Provider-specific extras (publish source target, restore revision id,
   *  missingCapabilities for forbidden outcomes, etc.) */
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
}

export interface AuditQuery {
  /** Match against actor.id (most common) or actor.email. */
  actor?: string
  action?: AuditEvent['action']
  outcome?: AuditEvent['outcome']
  scope?: { kind?: AuditEvent['scope']['kind']; name?: string }
  since?: string  // ISO timestamp
  until?: string
  limit?: number
}
```

## Providers

**v1 in-tree:**

- **`HistoryAuditProvider`** — extends existing `Revision` (in `packages/gazetta/src/history.ts`) with audit fields. Audit IS extended history.
  - Per-revision granularity (`rev-{ts}.json`); existing pattern for multi-instance correctness.
  - Pre-RBAC revisions read with synthetic `actor: { id: 'unknown', role: 'unknown', trustMode: 'none' }` (computed on read, not persisted).
  - Retention is configurable independently from history retention (see "Retention" section below).
  - Revisions split by category for retention purposes: content-bearing revisions (success outcomes) vs audit-only revisions (failure outcomes have no content snapshot).

**v2 reserved (deferred, demand-driven). Expected order — demand can reorder:**

| Rank | Provider | Why this order |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **`HttpWebhookAuditProvider`** — POST events to operator URL with `Authorization` header (env-var-supplied) | Universal — one provider serves dozens of downstream sinks (Datadog Logs, Splunk HEC, Loki, custom SIEMs). Smallest contract surface; smallest implementation cost. Stress-tests fail-open semantics first (operator URL flapping more common than managed-platform outages). |
| **2** | **`FileAuditProvider`** — `.gazetta/audit/{date}/events.jsonl` append-only; rotation via daily timestamp partition | Self-hosted operators with rsyslog / Promtail / Fluent Bit / Vector pulling from a file. Common deployment shape. Multi-instance: filesystem POSIX `O_APPEND` for small writes; R2/S3/Azure use per-instance file (`events.{instance-id}.jsonl`) — no contention. |
| **3** | **`OpenTelemetryAuditProvider`** — emits to any OTel collector | Modern observability standard; one provider serves Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana Cloud, AWS, Azure, GCP — all consume OTel. Reduces in-tree provider proliferation. |
| **4** | **`CloudWatchAuditProvider`** — emits to AWS CloudWatch Logs | AWS-specific; specific operator demand likely from regulated AWS customers. |
| **5** | **`AzureMonitorAuditProvider`** — emits to Azure Monitor Logs | Azure-specific; same shape as CloudWatch. |
| **6** | **`SyslogAuditProvider`** — emits to syslog (RFC 5424) | Niche — classic syslog infra. UDP-default is a security antipattern for compliance contexts (operators needing compliance use TLS-syslog). Lowest priority. |

External-sink Providers don't replace history. Operator can run `HistoryAuditProvider` as a peer for local browsable audit + external sink for tamper-evident retention.

**Plugin promotion trigger** (matching auth identity): 3+ operator requests for an unlisted provider within 6 months → either add in-tree (if mainstream) OR promote to plugin (if long-tail). Same trigger applies per-provider in the expected order; demand can reorder.

**HttpWebhookAuditProvider sub-shape** (first to ship):
- `POST {url}` with body = `AuditEvent` JSON
- Retry: 3 attempts with exponential backoff, then fail-open (logged as `transport` failure category)
- Auth: `Authorization` header from `GAZETTA_AUDIT_WEBHOOK_AUTH` env var
- HTTPS required in non-dev mode (refuses `http://` per existing pattern in `design-media.md`)
- `queryUrl()` returns null (operator's destination is opaque to Gazetta)

## Recording timing — synchronous fail-open

**Locked: synchronous, fail-open, parallel fan-out across providers.**

```ts
async function recordToAll(event: AuditEvent, providers: AuditProvider[]) {
  const results = await Promise.allSettled(
    providers.map(p => p.record(event))
  )
  for (const [i, r] of results.entries()) {
    if (r.status === 'rejected') {
      // structured log; never propagates to caller; never includes event payload
      logAuditFailure(providers[i].name, event.id, categorize(r.reason))
    }
  }
  // never throws — fail-open per Universal Provider Requirement #5
}
```

**Why synchronous (not fire-and-forget):**
- **Attempt-completion guarantee**: if the user got a success response, the audit attempt was completed (success or fail-open logged). Async queuing would lose in-flight events on process restart.
- **GDPR Article 5(2) accountability**: a deterministic write→audit relationship is documentable for regulator interviews; "events flow through a queue with N retries and may drop" is harder to defend.
- **RTBF safety**: scrub operations operate on stored events. Sync recording means the scrub CLI doesn't race with an in-memory queue.
- **SOC 2 CC7.2 monitoring**: the deterministic relationship is the attestation surface; async queuing makes monitoring depend on queue health.

**Why fail-open (not blocking):**
- Universal Provider Requirement #5 — "Audit fails open (audit failure must never block writes)."
- Audit-failure on a failure path must never block the failure response itself. Validation-rejection responses must not get an additional audit-recording-failed error stacked on top.

**Why parallel fan-out:**
- Two providers' latencies don't stack (matters when one is local + one is external-sink).
- Failures are independent; operators see all failures at once instead of "first failure wins."

**Strict mode opt-in:**

```yaml
admin:
  audit:
    strict: true   # any provider failure blocks the write
```

For HIPAA / SOC 2 compliance contexts where "audit recording confirmed successful" is a hard prerequisite for the write to proceed. Default off; opt-in.

**Latency budget (informational):**
- `HistoryAuditProvider` (local storage): ~5-50ms
- `CloudWatchAuditProvider`: ~50-200ms
- `HttpWebhookAuditProvider`: ~50-500ms (operator-URL-dependent)
- Multi-provider fan-out: cost of slowest provider (parallel)
- Acceptable on save (50-100ms invisible to authors); ~1-2% overhead on publish (already 1-30s).

## Configuration

Zero-config default — `HistoryAuditProvider` runs automatically; no `admin.audit` block needed.

```yaml
# Single-string Provider name
admin:
  audit:
    provider: cloudwatch    # SDK reads AWS_REGION + credentials from env
    # logGroup: gazetta-audit  # optional; default shown
```

```yaml
# List form for multi-Provider compliance scenarios
admin:
  audit:
    providers:
      - history             # local copy in target storage
      - cloudwatch          # also stream to CloudWatch
    strict: false           # default; audit failures never block writes
    actorPseudonym: none    # default; 'sha256' for opt-in pseudonymization
    recordSourceIp: false   # default; opt-in per GDPR consideration
    recordUserAgent: false  # default; opt-in per GDPR consideration
```

**Defaults per Provider** (sensible — operator overrides only when needed):
- `history` — uses target's `.gazetta/history/`; no override needed
- `cloudwatch` — log group `gazetta-audit`
- `azure-monitor` — workspace from `AZURE_LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID` env
- `syslog` — facility `local0`
- `file` — `./.gazetta/audit/`
- `opentelemetry` — endpoint from `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env

## Recording scope (v1)

Every write **attempt** — success and write-class rejection:

| Action | Recorded outcomes |
|---|---|
| `save` (page, fragment, or asset edit) | `success`, `validation-failed`, `forbidden`, `unauthenticated` |
| `publish` (any target) | `success`, `forbidden`, `unauthenticated` |
| `delete` (page, fragment, or asset) | `success`, `forbidden`, `unauthenticated` |
| `restore` (history rollback) | `success`, `forbidden`, `unauthenticated` |
| `configure-roles` (`site.yaml`'s `admin.auth.roleMapping` change) | `success`, `validation-failed`, `forbidden`, `unauthenticated` |

**Recording sites** (the layer that produced the outcome records its own event):
- Save/publish/delete handler success path → `success`
- Save/publish handler validation rejection (409) → `validation-failed`
- Capability middleware 403 path → `forbidden` (with `metadata.missingCapabilities`)
- Auth middleware 401 path → `unauthenticated`

**Anti-pattern avoided**: a global "audit interceptor" that wraps every handler and infers outcome from HTTP status. That couples audit to HTTP shape (forbids non-HTTP audit sources later, like CLI commands). Each site explicitly records its own outcome.

**Dedup discipline**: the layer that produced the outcome records once. Capability middleware short-circuits before the handler runs — one event per attempt, no double-recording. Plugin-provided middleware authors must follow the same rule.

**Audit-failure on a failure path must never block the failure response itself.** If a save fails validation and audit-recording the failure also fails, the user gets the validation error — not a separate audit-failed error obscuring the real one. Per Universal Provider requirement #5 (audit fails open).

**Deferred to v2 ambient log:**
- Reads (every API GET)
- Hook firings
- Cache reads / render-for-analysis

## Privacy defaults

- `sourceIp` and `userAgent` recording DEFAULT OFF. Operator opts in via `admin.audit.recordSourceIp` / `recordUserAgent` with documented GDPR consideration.

### Source IP recording (`admin.audit.recordSourceIp`)

```yaml
admin:
  audit:
    recordSourceIp: none           # 'none' | 'raw' | 'hashed' | 'truncated'
    trustedProxyHeader: X-Forwarded-For   # forwarded-user trust mode only
    trustedProxyCount: 1                  # number of trusted proxies in front of Gazetta
```

**Modes:**

| Mode | What's stored | Use case | Privacy posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `none` | nothing (field absent) | Default. No IP recording. | Strictest |
| `raw` | full client IP | Forensic / incident response with full IP. | GDPR-personal-data; operator declares processing |
| `hashed` | `sha256(ip + GAZETTA_AUDIT_SOURCEIP_SALT).slice(0, 16)` | "Same source across events?" queries with pseudonymization. Salt rotation breaks correlation. | Pseudonymized |
| `truncated` | `/24` (IPv4) or `/48` (IPv6) prefix | Geographic / network-segment forensics without device identification. | Privacy-friendly default for operators who want some data |

**Trust-mode-driven header extraction** (security-critical — leftmost-XFF naive read is an OWASP Trust Boundary Violation):

| Trust mode | Correct source for client IP |
|---|---|
| `none` | TCP peer (no proxy assumed) |
| `forwarded-user` | `X-Forwarded-For` with operator-configured `trustedProxyCount` (count back from rightmost; everything to the right is trusted, leftmost is client) |
| `cloudflare-access` | `Cf-Connecting-IP` (Cloudflare-specific, signed/trusted) |
| `azure-easy-auth` | `X-Forwarded-For` (Azure App Service appends one entry; `trustedProxyCount=1`) |
| `aws-cognito` | `X-Forwarded-For` (ALB appends one entry; `trustedProxyCount=1`) |
| `tailscale` | TCP peer (Tailscale serves direct; no proxy chain) |

Future plugin-supplied trust modes declare their own `getClientIp(req): string | null` per the auth-identity provider contract.

**Failure mode**: when the configured header is missing (proxy misconfiguration), `sourceIp` is omitted from the event (not `'[unparseable]'`). Explicitly absent is more honest; operator monitoring catches misconfiguration via "expected sourceIp not present" patterns.

**IPv6**: handled. Truncation uses `/48` for IPv6 (operators routinely receive a /48 from ISPs).

**Salt for `hashed` mode**: `GAZETTA_AUDIT_SOURCEIP_SALT` env var. Different salt from `GAZETTA_AUDIT_ACTOR_SALT` — rotating one shouldn't break the other.

### User agent recording (`admin.audit.recordUserAgent`)

```yaml
admin:
  audit:
    recordUserAgent: none          # 'none' | 'raw' | 'truncated'
```

| Mode | What's stored |
|---|---|
| `none` | nothing (field absent) |
| `raw` | full UA string |
| `truncated` | browser family + major version (e.g., `Chrome/119`); drops fingerprinting detail |

Lower priority than IP — most operators don't enable. No `hashed` mode for UA (low entropy makes hashing weak; if you want privacy, use `truncated` or `none`).
- Right-to-be-forgotten: future `gazetta audit scrub --actor=alice@example.com` CLI replaces actor field with `[scrubbed-{hash}]` in existing revisions. Hash is non-reversible. Required for GDPR-compliant operators. Trigger: validation Cut 5 CLI rewrite.

### Pseudonymization (`admin.audit.actorPseudonym`)

Default: `'none'`. Audit events store the upstream subject as-is.

```yaml
admin:
  audit:
    actorPseudonym: sha256   # opt-in privacy hardening
    # GAZETTA_AUDIT_ACTOR_SALT env var required when sha256 is enabled
```

**When to opt in:**
- External-sink configurations where audit events leave Gazetta's process boundary (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, OTel collector, HTTP webhook). Pseudonymization limits PII leakage if the sink's storage is compromised.
- Regulated contexts demanding pseudonymization-by-default (some EU healthcare contexts, German telecommunications data retention, etc.).
- Multi-tenant SIEM correlation where the operator wants to share hashes across systems (using a shared salt) without sharing raw subjects.

**Salt management:**
- Salt is a credential. Stored in `GAZETTA_AUDIT_ACTOR_SALT` env var per Universal Provider Requirement #3 ("Configuration via env vars for credentials"). Never in `site.yaml`.
- 16+ random bytes. Operator generates at site creation; documents the creation date as part of operational records.
- Salt rotation breaks historic correlation by design. Rotate per security policy (annually is typical); document rotation dates so forensic queries can scope by salt-era.
- Multi-instance: every instance reads the same env var → deterministic hash across instances. No coordination needed.

**Forensic implications:**
- Forensic queries by upstream subject: `actor.id == sha256(sub + salt).slice(0, 16)`. Operator who knows the sub and salt computes the hash and searches.
- Cross-system correlation: works when adjacent systems share the salt; otherwise opaque.
- Pre-rotation events become "pre-rotation-era" forensically — degraded but acceptable per the standard pseudonymization pattern.

**Why not Gazetta-internal GUIDs with a stored mapping**: rejected (POV-walked Q2 refinement). New state primitive, race conditions on first-encounter, multi-target correlation problems, and a mapping table that's itself PII to protect — all without delivering any privacy benefit that hashed-sub doesn't deliver more cleanly.

**Migration:**
- A → C (turning on pseudonymization): rolling-compatible. New events hash; old events stay raw. Mixed log forever — historic events typically less queried than recent.
- C → A (turning off): historic hashed events become un-recoverable to identity once the salt is destroyed. Effectively a one-way RTBF for the historic events. Document before turning off.

### Failure-log payload exclusion

When audit recording fails (fail-open per Universal Provider Requirement #5), the failure log entry MUST NOT contain event payload:

```ts
logAuditFailure(providerName: string, eventId: string, errorCategory: 'transport' | 'config' | 'schema')
```

Failure investigation requires re-examining the original audit attempt via providers that DID succeed — not by reading payload from the failure log. Prevents PII side-channels into application stderr / log shipping.

### External-sink data residency (GDPR Article 30)

Each configured external-sink provider is a separate processor for the operator's Article 30 record. Document residency per provider:

| Provider | Data residency |
|---|---|
| `history` | Same target storage as content; operator-controlled |
| `cloudwatch` | AWS region (`AWS_REGION` env) |
| `azure-monitor` | Workspace's region (`AZURE_LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID` resolves to a region) |
| `syslog` | Operator's syslog destination |
| `opentelemetry` | OTel collector's destination |
| `http-webhook` | Operator URL's region |

Cross-border transfers (EU operators using `cloudwatch us-east-1`) require Standard Contractual Clauses per Schrems II. Documented as an operator obligation; Gazetta provides the structural opt-in.

### In-flight encryption

| Provider | Encryption |
|---|---|
| `history` | Storage-provider-dependent (R2/S3/Azure native; filesystem operator-controlled) |
| `cloudwatch` | TLS via AWS SDK |
| `azure-monitor` | TLS via Azure SDK |
| `syslog` | Default UDP no encryption — operators needing compliance use TLS-syslog (rsyslog `gtls` or similar). Documented limitation. |
| `opentelemetry` | TLS via OTel exporter |
| `http-webhook` | HTTPS required in non-dev mode (refuses `http://` per the existing pattern from `design-media.md`) |

### Forbidden-event scope visibility

`forbidden` events record `scope` and `metadata.missingCapabilities` — useful for diagnosis but informative about user interest in restricted resources. Two postures:
- **v1 (document-only)**: audit logs are themselves access-controlled via `read:audit-log` capability. Admins with audit access see "who tried what." Acceptable for v1.
- **Future**: configurable scope masking (`forbidden` events on scope matching pattern X record scope as `[redacted]`). Reserved for regulated workflows; not v1.

## Retention

Audit retention is configurable independently from content history retention. Defaults to inherit history retention.

```yaml
admin:
  audit:
    retention:
      events: 10000        # max audit events to keep (per provider)
      maxAgeMonths: 72     # 6 years for HIPAA; null = no time limit
      # When neither set, defaults to history.retention (shared retention)
```

**Why separable**: compliance regimes specify retention windows (SOC 2 ~1 year, HIPAA 6 years, financial 7+ years, legal hold indefinite) that differ from content history retention budgets. Forcing `history.retention: 1000` to satisfy HIPAA audit balloons content storage; B lets operators keep 50 content revisions + 6 years of audit events independently.

**Two dimensions**: `events` (max count) AND `maxAgeMonths` (max age) — compliance often specifies both ("keep audit for 6 years AND no fewer than N events"). Operator sets one or both.

**Composition with content retention**:
- **Content-bearing revisions** (success outcomes — saves, publishes, restores with snapshots) — subject to BOTH content retention and audit retention; pruned/stripped per the more permissive.
- **Audit-only revisions** (failure outcomes — `forbidden` / `validation-failed` / `unauthenticated` — no content snapshot) — subject to audit retention only.

**Pruner mechanism** (extending the existing history pruner):
1. **Content pruning pass**: age out content-bearing revisions per `history.retention`.
2. **Audit pruning pass** (new): age out audit fields per `audit.retention.events` and `audit.retention.maxAgeMonths`. Audit-only revisions deleted; content-bearing-but-audit-stripped revisions retain content snapshot, lose actor / outcome / metadata.

**External-sink retention**: applies only to providers Gazetta owns the storage for (`history`, `file`). External-sink providers (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, OTel) have their own retention configured on the sink side. Operator pattern: "keep 90 days locally for fast queries; 6 years in CloudWatch for compliance" — `audit.retention.maxAgeMonths: 3` locally, CloudWatch log group `retentionInDays: 2192` separately. Documented.

**GDPR storage-limitation alignment** (Article 5(1)(e)): personal data shouldn't be kept longer than necessary. Long audit retention is the documented exception per Article 17(3)(b) — retention required by legal obligation overrides erasure. B lets operators set retention to their actual obligation; A would force inheritance from content retention which is the wrong constraint.

**Migration**: existing sites without `audit.retention` block inherit history retention (no breaking change).

## Tampering limitation

Audit log lives in target's writable storage; an admin with write access can edit revisions. v1 accepts this; external-sink Providers (v2) are the upgrade path for high-stakes operators who need tamper-evident logs. Documented as known limitation.

## Audit drawer — query semantics

The admin audit drawer (gated by `read:audit-log` capability) projects results based on configured providers. Each provider is one of two query shapes:

- **Query-capable** — implements `query()`. Returns events for the filter.
- **External-sink** — omits `query()`, optionally implements `queryUrl()` returning a deep-link to the operator's destination console.

**Drawer behavior matrix:**

| Configuration | Drawer state |
|---|---|
| `history` only | Local events list; no external link |
| `history` + `file` (both query-capable) | Merged events list; dedupe by `event.id` |
| `history` + `cloudwatch` (mixed) | Local events list + footer link "View full audit in CloudWatch" |
| `cloudwatch` only | Empty events list + prominent message "Audit lives in CloudWatch — [link]" |
| `cloudwatch` + `webhook` (no query, no link) | Message: "Audit configured but not queryable. Configure history as a peer provider for in-admin browsing." |

**Recommended operational pattern**: run `history` always (cheap, queryable, multi-instance-correct) + external-sink for tamper-evident retention. Best-of-both: in-admin browsability AND external compliance posture.

**Provider deep-link examples:**
- `cloudwatch.queryUrl()` → `https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region={AWS_REGION}#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/{logGroup}`
- `azure-monitor.queryUrl()` → workspace's Log Analytics URL
- `opentelemetry.queryUrl()` → null (collector destination is opaque to Gazetta)
- `http-webhook.queryUrl()` → null (operator's destination is opaque)
- `syslog.queryUrl()` → null (operator's syslog destination is opaque)

**Failure during query**: query() failures are fail-open per Universal Provider Requirement #5. Drawer surfaces "audit query unavailable" with the provider name; doesn't throw. Local query failures don't block external-sink links from being shown.

**Capability gating**: `read:audit-log` gates the drawer entirely. Without it, the drawer is absent — no link, no events, no configuration disclosure.

## Real-time observation pattern

Composes with future presence design:
- Pull-based: real-time consumer polls for new revisions since last seen ID. Multi-instance-correct (storage shared).
- File watcher as optimization where supported (filesystem provider only).
- Push-based webhooks (`HttpWebhookAuditProvider`) for operators who want low-latency external observation.

## Index sidecar pattern (reserved for v1.5/v2)

v1 ships full-scan only — at envelope (~25K events/year per `design-scale.md`), full scan is ~50ms on filesystem, ~500ms on R2/S3, well under the 5-second admin SLA.

**Trigger to move from reserved → designed (any one fires):**
- Query latency p95 > 2 seconds (operator-monitored)
- Event count > 100K per target
- 3+ operator reports of "audit query slow" within 6 months (matches the plugin-promotion trigger pattern)

**Reserved sidecar shape** (when triggered):

```
.gazetta/audit-index/
  actor/
    {actor.id}/
      rev-{ts}            # zero-byte file pointing at the revision
  date/
    {YYYY-MM-DD}/
      rev-{ts}
  scope/
    {scope.kind}.{scope.name}/
      rev-{ts}
  action-outcome/
    {action}-{outcome}/
      rev-{ts}
```

`readDir` on `.gazetta/audit-index/actor/alice@example.com/` returns matching revision IDs in O(N-matching), not O(total events). Per-edge granularity means concurrent writes don't race — validated pattern from asset-refs sidecars.

**Pruner integration when shipped**: index sidecars deleted alongside their revision during retention pruning (per-revision walk; no aggregate-file rewrite).

**RTBF integration when shipped**: scrub CLI moves index sidecars under `actor/{old-id}/` to `actor/[scrubbed-{hash}]/` as part of the rewrite operation.

**Why not ship from day one**: optimizing the 1% case (operators past hard limit) at the cost of the 99% case (operators at envelope) is wrong. Pattern is validated by asset-refs and history; shipping when triggered is cheap (1-2 days design + 3-5 days implementation).

## Foundational checks

How audit log composes with each of the other 11 foundational dimensions plus the multi-instance discipline.

### Multi-instance discipline
- Per-revision granularity (existing history pattern). Each instance writes its own revisions to ID-keyed files (`rev-{ts}.json`); reads aggregate via `readDir`. Multi-instance-correct by construction — no shared mutable state.
- Multi-provider fan-out is per-request stateless (parallel `Promise.allSettled`). No coordination across instances.
- Salt for actor / sourceIp pseudonymization read from env vars per-instance — deterministic across instances by sharing the env value.
- Retention pruning runs per-target; per-revision file granularity means concurrent pruners on the same target converge (delete idempotent on ENOENT).
- Index sidecars (when shipped) follow the per-edge pattern from asset-refs — concurrent writes don't race.

### Scale (#1)
- At envelope (~25K events/year per `design-scale.md`): full-scan grep ~50ms filesystem, ~500ms cloud storage — well under 5-second admin SLA.
- At 100K events: query latency p95 approaches 2 seconds — index sidecar trigger fires.
- At hard limit (250K+): index sidecars required for SLA.
- Audit recording cost: 50-200ms per event (sync fail-open, parallel fan-out). Acceptable on save (invisible to authors); ~1-2% overhead on publish (already 1-30s).
- External-sink providers add their own latency to the slowest-provider envelope.

### Locale (#2)
- Events scope locale via `metadata.locale` when relevant (e.g., a save of `page.fr.json` records `metadata.locale: 'fr'`). Consumers query by `metadata.locale` when locale-aware forensics needed.
- No per-locale audit retention or per-locale audit storage. Locale is informational only.
- RTBF scrub is locale-agnostic — scrubbing actor doesn't care which locale variants the actor edited.

### Themes (#3)
- Events record theme on writes via `metadata.theme` when the write was theme-scoped (e.g., theme-variant asset upload). Informational.
- No per-theme audit retention or per-theme audit storage.

### Auth + RBAC (#4)
- `actor` field is the load-bearing input from auth/RBAC. Snapshot of the principal at decision time (per Q2 lock).
- `read:audit-log` capability gates the audit drawer entirely. Without it, the drawer is absent — no link, no events, no configuration disclosure.
- Auth events themselves (login, role resolution failure, capability denial) are recorded by the auth-identity layer publishing audit events with `outcome: 'unauthenticated'` or `outcome: 'forbidden'` per Q1 lock.
- Audit-log read access is its own capability (`read:audit-log`) — viewers don't see audit by default.

### Review (#6)
- Every review-state transition is recorded as an audit event. State machine attributes each transition to a `Principal` so the history trail is reconstructable from audit log alone.
- Review configuration changes (`requiresPublishApproval` toggle) record as `action: 'configure-roles'`-class events (extending `action` enum if needed; reserved for the review design pass).
- Self-approval policy enforced at the review layer; audit records the attempt with appropriate outcome regardless of self-approval allow/deny.

### Hooks (#7)
- Hook firings record as audit events when `action: 'hook-fired'` lands in v2. v1 doesn't record hook firings (deferred per recording-scope-v1 lock).
- Plugin-supplied hooks that act on behalf of a system identity audit as the configured `serviceAccount` actor.
- Hook failures audit as the same actor that triggered the hook (the failure outcome reflects the hook handler's failure, not the trigger's).

### Render (#8)
- Render-for-analysis cache misses don't audit (reads are not in v1 recording scope).
- Static target render at publish time records the publishing actor; render-time anonymous reads don't.
- Dynamic SSR with `Principal` in render context: when permission-filtered output is computed, no per-render audit event (would explode event volume); the underlying capability check at the page-resolve level audits if it denied.

### Validation (#9)
- Validator failures don't audit (validators are pure functions over a manifest); save 409 responses DO audit with `outcome: 'validation-failed'` per Q1 lock — recorded by the receiving handler, not the validator.
- Background scanner failures (long-running) don't audit per-page; if scanner crashes, that's an operator log concern, not an audit event.
- Pre-publish gate strict-mode rejection records as `outcome: 'validation-failed'` on the publish attempt.

### Plugin (#10)
- `AuditProvider` is Extension Surface #11. Plugin-supplied providers inherit Universal Provider requirements (per ADR-0004): multi-instance correctness, stateless interface, env-var credentials, sensible defaults, fail-mode declared (audit fails open), never-throws-on-transport-errors, stable typed contract, independent error taxonomy (`AuditError`), operator config consistency, forward-compatible plugin promotion.
- Plugin promotion trigger: 3+ operator requests for an unlisted sink within 6 months.
- Plugin-supplied providers add to the catalog at the same `admin.audit.providers:` config level as in-tree providers.

### Cache (#11)
- `AdminCache` misses don't audit (reads not in v1 recording scope).
- Cache invalidation events (when a save invalidates `pages:` prefix) don't audit — invalidation is mechanical, not actor-attributable beyond the save itself.
- The save event already records the actor + scope; cache invalidation derives.

### Offline (#12)
- Replayed write events on reconnect record `metadata.replayed: true` + original-attempt timestamp + reconnect timestamp.
- Replay actor is captured at queue time, not replay time. If the actor lost the capability while offline, replay fails with `outcome: 'forbidden'` recorded at replay time, with `metadata.replayed: true` + original `metadata.queuedAt` timestamp.
- Offline write queue itself doesn't audit pre-queue (no server roundtrip to record); audit happens on replay attempt.

## Migration

Sites without `admin.audit` config use `HistoryAuditProvider` automatically. Existing history records get synthetic `actor: "unknown"` on read. No data migration.

## Future directions

- **Per-API-call recording** (reads + login attempts + failed authorization). Compliance-tier; deferred until SOC 2 / HIPAA demand.
- **External sink providers** (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, etc.). Demand-driven; in-tree on first 3 operator requests for the same provider.
- **Index sidecar** at hard-limit scale.
- **Audit log query CLI** (`gazetta audit query --actor=X --since=Y`). Lands with validation Cut 5 CLI rewrite.
- **Right-to-be-forgotten scrub CLI** (`gazetta audit scrub`). Same trigger.
- **Audit retention separate from history retention** — for compliance teams who keep audit longer than content history.
