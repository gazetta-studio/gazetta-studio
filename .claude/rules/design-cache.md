# Cache

Foundational dimension #11 of 13. Pluggable caching layer at the admin / origin server tier (L4 in the layered cache model). v1 ships `MemoryCache` only; abstraction in place so multi-instance deployments can swap providers without changing consumers.

**Status**: design pass complete (2026-05). Implementation phases sit in Tier 3.

**Companion docs**:
- [`feature-design-process.md`](feature-design-process.md) — defines the **Cache check** every new feature design must answer
- [`design-plugins.md`](design-plugins.md) — sibling extension-surface design; cache providers are one of the named surfaces
- [`design-scale.md`](design-scale.md) — first major consumer (`/api/pages`, `/api/fragments`, `/api/dependents`)

## Why this is foundational

Caching is foundational because:

1. **It's load-bearing for performance.** Several primitives at scale (admin's `/api/pages`, `/api/fragments`, fragment-resolution, future filtered listings) need caching to hold the latency SLA. Caching ad-hoc per-feature creates inconsistent semantics + invalidation bugs.

2. **Multi-instance correctness depends on the cache shape.** A per-instance in-memory cache is fine for single-process deployments; a multi-instance deployment needs a shared cache provider (Redis, Azure storage, distributed cache) OR explicit per-instance scope with carefully designed invalidation. Getting this wrong silently corrupts state — exactly the class of bug the multi-instance discipline exists to prevent.

3. **It's an extension surface.** Operators choose memory vs. Redis vs. Azure vs. file-based per their deployment shape. Same pattern as storage providers, AI providers, transform adapters — pluggable behind one interface.

## Layered cache model (zoomed-out context)

Caching in Gazetta happens at multiple layers. This design pass scopes ONLY to L4. Other layers governed by their own design passes:

| Layer | Strategy | Owned by |
|---|---|---|
| L1: Browser HTTP | Content-addressed immutable URLs | `design-media.md`, `design-rendering.md` |
| L2: CDN edge | Content-addressed immutable; skip dynamic | `design-rendering.md` Q1 |
| L3: Worker memory + edge KV | Per-worker memory + content-addressed reads | `design-rendering.md` Q1 |
| **L4: Admin/Origin server** | **Deterministic-derived memoization (this design pass)** | **`design-cache.md` (this doc)** |
| L5: Storage sidecars | Per-edge content-addressed sidecars | `sidecars.md` |
| L6: Browser admin | Persistent client-side; SSE-invalidated | `design-offline.md` (pending) — extends `AdminCache` taxonomy |

L4 is where `AdminCache` lives. L6 reuses the `AdminCache` interface for taxonomy reuse but coordinates independently.

## Locked invariants

### Inherited from prior thinking
- **`AdminCache` is the abstraction at L4** — features that cache data at the admin server tier go through it; no ad-hoc memos in feature code.
- **Provider-pluggable** — `MemoryCache` ships as v1 default; Redis, Azure storage, file-based, distributed providers slot in via the same interface (Universal Provider Requirements per `design-plugins.md`).
- **Multi-instance discipline holds**:
  - `MemoryCache` is per-instance scope (multi-instance-correct via independence; eventual consistency across instances acceptable because each receives SSE invalidation for its own writes).
  - Shared providers (Redis, Azure) are multi-instance-correct via the provider's own coordination.
  - In-process caches OUTSIDE `AdminCache` are governed by the existing multi-instance discipline: scoped to one operation (per-build, per-request) only.
- **Storage-as-cache is allowed.** A cache provider can use the existing `StorageProvider` abstraction (e.g., `FileCache` writes to `.gazetta/cache/`). Atomic write-then-rename per the provider contract.

### Locked in this design pass

**Deterministic-derived principle (Q2 lock):**

> **Cache values must be derivable from inputs encoded in the key.** Two instances computing the same key produce the same value. Concurrent writes are idempotent. Read-modify-write patterns are not supported in v1.

This pushes the discipline to cache CONSUMERS (write deterministic functions of inputs), not the cache provider. Multi-instance correctness on shared providers (v2) follows naturally — two instances writing the same key write the same value, so last-write-wins is a no-op.

**Why not etag-based optimistic concurrency in v1**: enumerated v1 consumers (page summaries, fragment summaries, dependents, render-for-analysis, page query cache) are all read-only with explicit invalidation. Zero v1 consumers do read-modify-write on cache. Etag interface ships when first concrete RMW consumer surfaces (warming hooks future) as `EtagCapableCache extends AdminCache` — additive, not breaking.

**Cache invalidation: explicit per-feature with sidecar-driven cascades (Q2 lock):**

- Save handlers explicitly enumerate affected cache prefixes (`cache.invalidatePrefix('pages:')`)
- Cross-cutting cascades use existing sidecar machinery (`findDependentsFromSidecars` for fragment→page dependencies)
- TTL is fallback safety net, not primary invalidation mechanism

**Generic dependency-aware invalidation rejected**: tracking dependencies in the cache layer requires reverse-dep graphs that must be coordinated across instances OR rebuilt per-instance (which defeats the cache). Sidecars already solve this at L5 — explicit per-feature invalidation at L4 reads sidecars to compute the affected set, no cache-layer dep graph needed.

**SSE broadcast for cross-instance coordination (Q2 lock):**

Each provider implements `subscribe(handler)` per its coordination mechanism:
- `MemoryCache` — process-internal `EventEmitter`
- `RedisCache` — Redis pub/sub
- `AzureCache` — Azure Service Bus or Redis pub/sub

Save flow: write manifest → write sidecars → invalidate L4 entries → SSE broadcast → other instances invalidate L4 → connected browsers invalidate L6.

**Best-effort invalidation atomicity** (Q2 lock):

Cache invalidation is fail-open per Universal Provider Requirement #5. Failed invalidation = stale cache entry → next read serves stale → TTL or next-invalidation-cycle catches it. Atomicity across N invalidations isn't possible in distributed systems anyway.

**Key conventions (Q1 lock):**

- **Format**: colon-separated `{domain}:{op}:{id?}:{dim1}:{dim2}...`
- **Compound keys**: concatenated values (not hashed) — preserves prefix-invalidation; human-readable in logs
- **Special-char encoding**: same as sidecars (`encodeRefName` from `hash.ts`; slashes → dots)
- **Reserved prefixes**: built-ins (`pages:`, `fragments:`, `assets:`, `dependents:`, `targets:`, `routes:`, `audit:`, `review:`, `history:`, `config:`); plugin-contributed under plugin name (`{plugin-name}:...`)
- **Schema versioning**: automatic Gazetta-major-version prefix applied by the cache layer (consumer sees `pages:summary`; provider stores `1:pages:summary` where `1` is from `gazetta.version.major`)

### Offline composition (L4 + L6)

L4 (admin server `AdminCache`) and L6 (browser admin's `IndexedDBCache` / `LocalStorageCache` per `design-offline.md`) share the `AdminCache` interface but coordinate independently. L6 reuses the interface so the same consumer code works whether reading from server cache or browser cache.

- **Cached values MUST be JSON-serializable.** No functions, no Symbols, no Maps/Sets at top level. Required so L6 can persist values to IndexedDB/localStorage. Documented as a v1 contract.
- **L4 → L6 invalidation cascade.** Server-side L4 invalidation triggers SSE broadcast. Browser-side `AdminCache` providers subscribe to the SSE channel and invalidate L6 entries in response. `subscribe()` method on `AdminCache` is the coordination primitive.
- **Principal scoping is consumer's responsibility.** Cache keys for principal-scoped values include role/principal identity in the key (e.g., `pages:summary:role:editor`); shared values omit it. Role change invalidates by prefix (`cache.invalidatePrefix('pages:summary:role:editor:')`). Per `design-auth-rbac.md`'s Foundational checks ("Cached entries scoped to the role principal at cache time").
- **L6 stale-tolerance vs L4 freshness**: L6 explicitly tolerates staleness when server unreachable (offline mode); L4 does not. Different freshness contracts on the same interface — consumer can try L6 first, fall through to L4 if L6 entry is empty/stale or if the consumer is online.

L6 provider details (`IndexedDBCache`, `LocalStorageCache`, browser-tab scoping, IndexedDB transactions) are `design-offline.md`'s concern. This design pass commits only that:
- L6 providers implement `AdminCache`
- L4 + L6 share the interface
- Cached values are JSON-serializable
- Principal scoping encoded in key by consumer

## AdminCache interface (v1 locked)

```ts
export interface AdminCache {
  /** Get cached value or null on miss. */
  get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null>
  /** Set value with optional TTL (seconds). Provider may ignore TTL if it doesn't support expiry. */
  set<T>(key: string, value: T, opts?: { ttl?: number }): Promise<void>
  /** Invalidate one key. */
  invalidate(key: string): Promise<void>
  /** Invalidate all keys matching a prefix. Returns count cleared. */
  invalidatePrefix(prefix: string): Promise<number>
  /** Subscribe to invalidation events from other instances. Returns disposer. */
  subscribe(handler: (event: InvalidationEvent) => void): () => void
  /** Stats for diagnostics — hit rate, size, age distribution. Optional. */
  stats?(): Promise<CacheStats>
}

export interface InvalidationEvent {
  prefix: string
  source: { instance: string; timestamp: string }
}

export interface CacheStats {
  hits: number
  misses: number
  size: number
  // Provider-specific extras allowed
}
```

**Reserved for v2** — `EtagCapableCache extends AdminCache` adds `getWithEtag` + `setIfMatch` for read-modify-write consumers (warming hooks, derived counters). Ships when first concrete RMW consumer surfaces; additive interface; existing providers + consumers unaffected.

## PWA-style responsiveness principle

The admin UI should never block the user on cache operations. Cache supports progressive web app patterns:

- **Optimistic UI**: UI renders changes immediately; cache + storage sync in background
- **Stale-while-revalidate reads**: consumer returns cached value instantly, recomputes in background, updates UI when fresh value lands
- **Background sync**: writes queued offline, replayed transparently on reconnect (per `design-offline.md`)
- **Skeleton states**: UI never blank; cache provides last-known value while fresh recomputation runs

Cache layer doesn't add SWR or optimistic-update primitives — these are consumer-implemented patterns. The `AdminCache` interface stays minimal; consumers compose the patterns.

**Operation latency contract** (v1):
- `get` / `set`: microseconds (`MemoryCache`) or single-round-trip (~1-5ms on Redis/Azure). No cap needed.
- `invalidate(key)`: single-key delete; bounded by provider primitive.
- `invalidatePrefix(prefix)`: **best-effort with time cap (~100ms default; configurable per-provider).** Save handlers don't wait beyond the cap; un-cleared entries clear on next save's invalidation OR at TTL OR via next SSE broadcast. Locked invariant: cache invalidation never blocks the response beyond the cap.
- `subscribe`: returns immediately; handler invocations happen on the provider's event loop.

**Why best-effort `invalidatePrefix`**: at envelope (~5K pages), `invalidatePrefix('pages:')` could touch thousands of keys. Synchronous full-clear blocks the save response. Best-effort with cap matches PWA responsiveness — save returns fast; cache catches up via TTL or next event.

## TTL strategy (Q3 locked)

- **No default TTL.** `set()` without explicit `ttl` keeps value until explicit invalidation. Reinforces the locked invariant that invalidation is explicit, not TTL-driven. Default-1h TTL would mask wrong invalidation logic for an hour before self-correcting — a hostile bug pattern (works in test, fails in prod after window).
- **Explicit TTL accepted** when consumers have a real reason: AI suggestion caches bound by external API rate limits + cost, for example, set `{ ttl: 86400 }` to cache for 24h.
- **Provider implements lazy expiry**: `MemoryCache` checks timestamp on read; expired entries removed and treated as cache miss. No setTimeout overhead. Redis/Azure use native expiry.
- **No maximum TTL bound.** Consumers set what they need; operators monitor cache health via `stats()`.
- **Provider may ignore TTL if unsupported** per the existing locked invariant; documented per-provider.

## Gap-fill locks

Walking systematic gap analysis surfaced six concerns; locking each:

### Gap 1 — `MemoryCache` size limits + eviction

- **Default cap**: 10,000 entries OR 50MB (whichever hits first)
- **Eviction policy**: LRU on overflow
- **Operator overrides**: `admin.cache.memory.maxEntries` / `admin.cache.memory.maxBytes`
- **Stats track evictions count**; operators monitor for cap-hit pattern
- **Shared providers** (Redis, Azure): provider's responsibility (e.g., Redis `maxmemory` config); Gazetta doesn't enforce

### Gap 2 — Key length limit

- **Cap at 255 chars** (filesystem-provider compatibility)
- **Overflow portion hashed** (sha256 prefix); preserves prefix-invalidation when prefix < cap
- **Cache layer applies transparently**; consumers see clean keys

Example:
- Consumer key: `pages:detail:very-long-page-name:en:light:role:editor:p:abc123` (300+ chars)
- Provider stores: `pages:detail:very-long-page-name:en:light:role:editor:p:{sha256(rest).slice(0,8)}` (capped at 255)
- Prefix invalidation on `pages:detail:very-long-page-name:` still works

### Gap 3 — Single-Site-per-process invariant

Per the locked invariant in [`CONTEXT.md`](../../CONTEXT.md): each Gazetta runtime invocation loads exactly one Site. Multi-Site Projects exist as a layout concern (operator picks one Site per command), not a runtime concern.

- **Per-process `AdminCache` instance**: one Site per process means one cache per process; isolation is automatic via process boundaries
- **`gazetta.config.ts defaults.cache`**: accepts a constructed `AdminCache` instance (operator writes `defaults: { cache: memoryCache({...}) }`). Each process re-evaluates `gazetta.config.ts` and gets a fresh instance; no cross-Site sharing concern exists in-process because there are no other Sites in-process
- **Shared-provider implementations** (Redis, Azure, future): the operator's deployment runs N Site processes, each connecting to the same Redis as one logical cache. Each process's local in-memory adapter wraps the shared backing service; no per-Site key prefixing required (Site identity is enforced at the process boundary)
- **Cross-Site cache sharing across processes**: not a Gazetta concern. Two Site processes that happen to share Redis credentials get separate logical caches because each process keys against its own Site's content paths; collision requires intentional operator misconfiguration

### Gap 4 — Boot-time subscribe behavior

- **Default: boot, subscribe in background** (matches PWA responsiveness principle)
- During the unsubscribed window, cache continues serving from existing entries; transparent to consumers
- **Strict-mode opt-in**: `admin.cache.requireSubscribeOnBoot: true` blocks boot until subscribe established (with timeout); for compliance/regulated contexts where eventual consistency during the window is unacceptable
- **Subscribe failure during boot** (with default): provider auto-reconnects with backoff (per Q4 lock); admin serves; operators see warning logs

### Gap 5 — `CacheError` taxonomy

```ts
export class CacheError extends Error { /* base */ }

export class CacheConfigurationError extends CacheError {
  // Thrown at admin boot when config is invalid (missing env var,
  // malformed connection string, etc.). Admin won't start.
}

export class CacheSchemaError extends CacheError {
  // Thrown when a stored value can't be deserialized.
  // Rare; logs + returns null typically.
}
```

Throws reserved for unrecoverable infrastructure errors per Universal Provider Requirement #6. Transport / network errors fail-open (no throw); structured logs only. Same pattern as `StorageError`, `AuditError`, etc.

### Gap 6 — Target dimension in keys

- **Target is a first-class dimension in cache keys when value is target-scoped**:
  ```
  pages:summary:target:production
  pages:summary:target:staging
  fragments:detail:header:target:production
  ```
- **Convention**: target dimension as `:target:{name}` in compound keys
- Pages/fragments lookups always include target dimension (target-scoped by design — different targets can have different content per `design-publishing.md`)
- Genuinely target-agnostic data (user role mappings, site config snapshot) omits target dimension
- Consumer responsibility (Q1 already locked compound keys as concatenated values)

## Fallback behavior (Q4 locked)

All cache operations fail-open per Universal Provider Requirement #5. Aligns with PWA responsiveness principle — UI shows last-known value rather than error.

| Operation | On transport / provider failure |
|---|---|
| `get(key)` | Returns null (indistinguishable from cache miss to consumers); structured warning logged |
| `set(key, value)` | Always resolves; transport failures logged; no throw per Universal Provider Requirement #6 |
| `invalidate(key)` | Logs + falls through; TTL is the safety net |
| `invalidatePrefix(prefix)` | Best-effort within time cap (per PWA section); failures logged; fall through |
| `subscribe(handler)` | Auto-reconnects with backoff on connection drop |

**`subscribe` reconnect strategy**: full local cache reset on reconnect. Cache divergence during disconnected window is hard to detect surgically; full reset is the simplest correctness mechanism. L4 cache warmup is fast (recompute from storage). Operators monitor reconnect frequency via stats; frequent disconnects = network problem to fix.

**Permanent provider unavailability** (e.g., Redis configured but service permanently down): admin continues serving from source-of-truth. All operations fail-open. Operators see warning logs + cache hit-rate at 0 in stats. Gazetta does NOT auto-fall-back to a different provider — that would be magic; operator's monitoring catches the issue and they fix the underlying problem.

## Observability (Q5 locked)

**`CacheStats` shape** — required fields + optional richer fields:

```ts
interface CacheStats {
  hits: number
  misses: number
  size: number               // entry count
  errors: number             // transport failures since last reset
  // Optional richer fields (provider-supported)
  bytesApproximate?: number
  evictions?: number
  subscribeReconnects?: number
  oldestEntryAt?: string     // ISO timestamp
  lastInvalidation?: { prefix: string; at: string; source: string }
}
```

**Surfaces**:

| Surface | Audience | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Structured log every 5 minutes** | Ops engineers via existing log channel | Integrates with Datadog / New Relic / Splunk monitoring |
| **`GET /api/system/cache/stats`** | Operators via API or admin UI | Current snapshot for on-demand pulls |
| **`/admin/system/cache` page** (Tier 3) | Operators investigating issues | Live stats + history; full diagnostics |

**Rejected v1 surfaces**:
- **Toolbar widget with hit-rate** — author-irrelevant; noise in the editing UI
- **Cold-start metrics** — operators infer from per-period hit rate (low immediately after boot; ramps up); not load-bearing
- **`resetStats()` method** — stats reset only on admin restart; "reset and watch" workflow uses restart

**Stats overhead**: always-on counter increments per operation. Negligible cost (nanoseconds per op); observability value too high to gate behind opt-in. Locked as always-on.

**Stats logging cadence**: 5-minute period emits ~288 entries/day per provider. Low log volume; fine-grained enough to spot issues. Cadence is not configurable in v1 (operators with stricter monitoring needs can poll `/api/system/cache/stats`).

## Plugin-contributed cache providers (Q6 locked)

Per `design-plugins.md` Q3, plugins register providers via `api.registerCacheProvider(name, factory)`. Operators select one in `site.config.ts`:

```ts
import customCachePlugin from '@my-org/distributed-cache'

export default defineSite({
  admin: {
    plugins: [customCachePlugin()],
    cache: {
      provider: 'distributed-cache',  // matches name registered by plugin
      url: process.env.DISTRIBUTED_CACHE_URL!,
    },
  },
})
```

**`CacheProviderFactory` shape**:

```ts
type CacheProviderFactory = (config: unknown) => AdminCache | Promise<AdminCache>
```

The `config` parameter is opaque — provider-specific shape. Provider validates via Zod at construction; throws `CacheConfigurationError` on invalid config (per Gap 5 lock).

**Multi-instance correctness for plugin providers**:

Plugin authors satisfy Universal Provider Requirement #1 by declaring one of two patterns:

| Pattern | Examples | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-instance scope** | `MemoryCache`, `IndexedDBCache` | Cheap; eventual consistency via SSE invalidation acceptable |
| **Shared via provider's own coordination** | Redis cluster, DynamoDB, distributed cache | Required for high cache hit rate across multi-instance team deployments |

Plugin documentation MUST declare which pattern. Per the deterministic-derived principle (Q2 lock), values are idempotent across instances — providers don't need exotic CRDTs.

**`EtagCapableCache` (v2 forward-compat)**: when `EtagCapableCache extends AdminCache` ships in v2 (for read-modify-write consumers), plugin authors with shared providers MUST implement it OR document explicitly that their provider doesn't support RMW. v1 plugin authors target `AdminCache` only.

**In-tree vs plugin-contributed**:

| Path | Examples |
|---|---|
| **In-tree (Gazetta ships)** | Mainstream providers — `MemoryCache` (v1); `RedisCache`, `AzureCache`, `FileCache` (v2 demand-driven) |
| **Plugin-contributed** | Niche providers — `@my-org/dynamodb-cache`, `@my-org/memcached`, `@my-org/distributed-cache` |

Same `AdminCache` interface either way. Operator selection by name in `admin.cache.provider` config. New built-in shipped per the 3+ operator request trigger from `design-plugins.md` plugin-promotion pattern.

**Contract test helper**:

Plugin authors validate their providers against the contract:

```ts
// In a plugin's test suite
import { adminCacheContractTests } from 'gazetta/testing'
import { createDistributedCache } from './src'

describe('distributed-cache', () => {
  adminCacheContractTests(
    () => createDistributedCache({ url: 'redis://localhost:6379' }),
    'distributed-cache'
  )
})
```

The suite tests:
- Get-set-invalidate round-trip
- Prefix invalidation correctness
- TTL expiry behavior
- Subscribe/notify across two instances of the same provider
- Fail-open on transport simulation
- Best-effort prefix invalidation cap
- Stats accuracy

`adminCacheContractTests` ships from `gazetta/testing`. Implementation deliverable for the implementation PR; design pass commits that the contract test exists.

## Foundational checks

How cache composes with each of the other 12 foundational dimensions plus the multi-instance discipline.

### Multi-instance discipline
- `MemoryCache` is per-instance; eventual consistency via SSE invalidation broadcasts. Each instance independent.
- Shared providers (Redis, Azure) coordinate via their own atomicity primitives.
- Deterministic-derived value principle (Q2 lock) ensures idempotent writes — two instances writing the same key write the same value; last-write-wins is a no-op.
- `subscribe()` auto-reconnects with backoff (Q4 lock); full local cache reset on reconnect.
- Single-Site-per-process invariant (Gap 3 lock; locked in `CONTEXT.md`); each process holds its own cache instance for the one Site it serves.

### Scale (#1)
- `MemoryCache` capped at 10K entries / 50MB by default (Gap 1 lock); LRU eviction.
- Best-effort `invalidatePrefix` with ~100ms time cap (PWA section); large prefix invalidations don't block save responses.
- Stats overhead negligible (atomic counter increments).
- Cache layer is the load-bearing performance primitive for `/api/pages`, `/api/fragments`, `/api/dependents` at envelope.

### Locale (#2) + Themes (#3)
- Locale and theme appear in compound keys when value varies by them (per Q1 — concatenated values).
- Cache invalidation on save respects locale/theme variants — saving `page.fr.json` invalidates `pages:detail:home:fr:*`, leaves `:en:*` untouched.

### Auth + RBAC (#4)
- Cache keys for principal-scoped values include role/principal identity (per Q3 lock + `design-auth-rbac.md` Foundational checks).
- Role change invalidates by prefix (`cache.invalidatePrefix('pages:summary:role:editor:')`).
- `read:audit-log` results not cached cross-request (per `design-audit.md` Foundational checks).

### Audit (#5)
- Save handlers invalidate cache per Q2 lock; invalidation events audit as part of the triggering save's audit (no separate `action: 'cache-invalidate'` event — would explode event volume).
- Cache subscribe-failures audit as warnings (Q4 lock).
- Per `design-audit.md` Foundational checks: AdminCache misses don't audit (volume).

### Review (#6)
- Cache entries scoped by review state when relevant (e.g., `pages:summary:state:approved` vs `pages:summary:state:pending-review`); consumer encodes in key.
- Review state transitions invalidate cache entries that depend on state.

### Hooks (#7)
- Hook firings don't cache (each invocation independent).
- Plugin-supplied providers register via `api.registerCacheProvider()` (Q6 lock).
- Future cache warming hooks reserved (per Future directions); v1 admins boot with cold cache.

### Render (#8)
- Render-for-analysis cache (validation Cut 3) keyed by content + dependency hashes; deterministic-derived (Q2 principle).
- Page query cache (per `design-rendering.md` Q4 listings): per-instance via `MemoryCache`; invalidated on save.
- Worker cache (L3) is governed by `design-rendering.md` Q1; not part of this design pass.

### Validation (#9)
- Validator results cached when expensive (axe-core, html-validate, Lighthouse); content-hash key.
- Cache invalidation on save flows through normal Q2 lock.

### Plugin (#10)
- `AdminCache` is Extension Surface #11 per ADR-0004.
- Plugin-contributed providers register via `api.registerCacheProvider()` (Q6 lock).
- `adminCacheContractTests` helper for plugin authors.

### Offline (#12)
- L4 (server) + L6 (browser) share the `AdminCache` interface; coordinate independently (per offline composition section).
- Cached values MUST be JSON-serializable so L6 can persist them.
- L4 → L6 invalidation cascade via SSE.

### Collaboration (#13)
- Comment counts and notification badges cached per page; invalidated on collaboration events when collaboration ships per `design-collaboration.md`.

### Site config (`design-config.md`)
- One `AdminCache` instance per process, constructed at config-eval time. Operator's `cache:` field at site level (or `defaults.cache` at gazetta level) is a factory call returning the instance.
- Config evaluated at boot; cache provider initialized once.
- Dev hot-reload of config triggers full process restart for cache (graceful, simple).

## Provider implementations

**v1 (this design pass + scale implementation):**

- **`MemoryCache`** — `Map`-backed, per-instance, no expiry by default (TTL optional). Default for all deployments. Multi-instance-correct via per-instance independence.

**v2 (post-design-pass, demand-driven):**

- **`RedisCache`** — `ioredis` or similar; standard distributed cache pattern. Shared across all admin instances. Required for multi-instance team deployments where cache hit rate matters.
- **`AzureCache`** — Azure Cache for Redis (managed); same shape as `RedisCache` with Azure-specific connection.
- **`FileCache`** — disk-backed cache under `.gazetta/cache/`. Useful for small teams without a Redis instance who still want persistence across admin restarts.
- **`DistributedCache`** — opt-in for enterprise tier; consistent-hashing across multiple Redis nodes or similar.

**Browser-side providers** (per `design-offline.md`, foundational dimension #10):

- **`IndexedDBCache`** — large quotas (~50MB+), structured queries; default browser-side provider for offline-mode admin clients.
- **`LocalStorageCache`** — small quotas (~5MB); fallback for older browsers.

Browser-side providers are scoped to one browser tab; never shared across browsers / users / instances. They're peers to the server-side providers — implementing the same `AdminCache` interface — but coordinated independently. Server SSE invalidation events broadcast to connected browsers to invalidate their browser caches.

Operator config in `site.config.ts` (per `design-config.md`):

```ts
import { defineSite } from 'gazetta'

export default defineSite({
  // ...
  admin: {
    cache: {
      provider: 'memory',                          // v1 default
      // provider: 'redis',
      // url: process.env.REDIS_URL!,
      // provider: 'azure',
      // connectionString: process.env.AZURE_REDIS_CONN!,
      // provider: 'file',
      // path: './.gazetta/cache',
    },
  },
})
```

## Migration

Existing memo caches (e.g., `findDependentsFromSidecars` per-process memo, the existing template scan cache) migrate to `AdminCache` with `MemoryCache` provider. Behavior unchanged at v1; doors open for v2 swap.

## Future directions

**Distributed cache for enterprise.** Multi-region Gazetta deployments (e.g., admin in US + EU regions both serving the same content) need region-aware cache distribution. Consistent-hashing across Redis cluster, or per-region cache with cross-region invalidation. Tier 3 enterprise tier work.

**Cache warming hooks.** Per `design-hooks.md`, a hook lifecycle phase that fires on admin boot to pre-warm specific cache keys (e.g., the most-recently-edited 100 pages). Useful for reducing cold-start latency on cloud deployments. Reserved for after hooks ship.

**Read-through pattern.** Higher-level abstraction where consumers declare their cache key + miss-resolution function and `AdminCache` orchestrates. Reduces boilerplate at consumer sites. Could be a v2 ergonomics improvement; v1 is fine with explicit get/set.
