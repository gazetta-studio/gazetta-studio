# Dev Glossary

Process and infrastructure vocabulary used across this project's design docs,
team preferences, bots, and AI-agent surfaces. Companion to [`CONTEXT.md`](../../CONTEXT.md)
(product domain) — this file covers HOW we work, that file covers WHAT we
build.

Entries appear when a term is project-specific (precise meaning here that
doesn't generalize), used in two or more places, and surprised someone
recently (i.e. needed disambiguation in conversation or PR review). Single-use
coinages and obvious general English don't earn entries.

Add entries lazily — when a term first surfaces a real ambiguity. Don't
audit speculatively.

## Design process

**Discovery**:
Phase 1 of feature work. Read existing design docs, audit competitors, walk
the relevant scenarios, identify the actor types affected. May produce a
durable research artifact under [`docs/audits/`](../../docs/audits/) when
substantial. See [feature-design-process.md](feature-design-process.md).

**UX-grilling**:
Dedicated grilling pass for the user-facing surface, run BEFORE
implementation-grilling so UX choices aren't compromised by implementation
convenience. Walks actor scenarios, flow sketches, "what can I remove?"
(Krug-aligned), failure-mode UX, capability-gap surfaces. Output: the design
doc's "UX check" section.

**Story-as-spec** (design-then-spec-then-bot-execute):
The pattern for getting feature-bot to implement UX cuts reliably. The bot
is fine at *implementing* Vue components but bad at *designing* them — so the
UX design decision is moved into a prior, human-authored, executable artifact:
a Storybook story enumerating the component's states. The human (or a
UX-grilling pass) authors the stories; the bot implements the component to
satisfy them. This makes [team-preferences.md rule 31](team-preferences.md)
(TDD-first when delegating to AI) cover UI: the story is the failing spec, the
implementation turns it green. The cut sub-issue's `## Tests` section then
reads "component renders correctly for every state in `X.stories.tsx`." Per
[ADR-0016](../../docs/adr/0016-storybook-for-bot-executable-ux-specs.md).

**DevPlayground vs Storybook** (the two component-isolation surfaces):
Two surfaces, no overlap, per [ADR-0016](../../docs/adr/0016-storybook-for-bot-executable-ux-specs.md).
**DevPlayground** (`/admin/dev`) — template live-preview *with real content*;
template-developer turf ("does my template render this page correctly?").
**Storybook** — admin-shell component states (banners, dialogs, badges,
action bars) *as design + bot spec*; CMS-developer turf ("what are this
component's states, and is its implementation correct against them?"). A
component goes in Storybook when it's admin chrome with discrete states a
human designs and a bot implements; in DevPlayground when it's a content
template previewed against author content.

**5K-envelope gate**:
Pre-implementation checkpoint validating that proposed primitives hold at
the documented operating envelope (5,000 pages, 20,000 assets, 50 components
per page) per [design-scale.md](design-scale.md). Required between
UX-grilling and implementation-grilling. Failure means redesign before
proceeding — not "we'll add a sidecar later." See
[team-preferences.md rule 24](team-preferences.md).

**Implementation-grilling**:
Second grilling pass after UX-grilling. Walks the technical design tree:
architecture, data model, lifecycle, multi-instance, cache, audit, hooks,
validation, render, plugin, offline, collaboration. One question at a time
with named rejected alternatives per question.

**Grilling**:
The shared technique used in UX-grilling and implementation-grilling. One
structural question at a time, present 2-3 alternatives, recommend with
reasoning, wait for confirmation, capture decision. Codified by the
[`grill-with-docs`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-skills/tree/main/skills/grill-with-docs)
and `grill-me` skills. The discipline: never lock a Q without enumerated
rejected alternatives ([rule 25](team-preferences.md)).

**Retrospective**:
Phase 5 of feature work. After ship (or at significant milestones), review
the session for new learnings. Produces durable artifacts: new entries in
`team-preferences.md`, updates to `feature-design-process.md`, or new ADRs.
The conversation itself is ephemeral; the artifacts are the point.

**Foundational dimensions**:
Thirteen cross-cutting concerns every feature design must respect (Scale,
Themes, Locale, Auth+RBAC, Audit, Review, Hooks, Rendering, Validation,
Plugin, Cache, Offline, Collaboration). Plus the discipline of
Multi-instance correctness. Each has its own design pass; new features
answer each one in their "Foundational checks" section.

**Non-foundational disciplines**:
Six narrower invariants that compose with implementation but don't rise to
dimension level: MCP schema discipline, real-time event-source discipline,
multi-instance discipline, logging discipline, no-aggregate-manifests rule,
capability-gap-UX-at-four-points. Documented inline in
[feature-design-process.md](feature-design-process.md), not in their own
design files.

## Design documentation

**Design doc** (`design-{feature}.md`):
Required durable artifact per feature. Captures Scope, Companion docs,
Design model, Distinctive choices, Foundational checks, UX check, Migration,
Open questions, Future directions. Survives the feature shipping; describes
the durable model. Distinct from the implementation doc (which is pruned at
ship time).

**Implementation doc** (`design-{feature}-implementation.md`):
Working document per feature. Status table, per-cut scope, effort estimates,
deferred items, SOLID checks per cut. Pruned at the same commit that ships
the last cut — kept entries: header pointer to the design doc, deferred-items
table (for v1.5 planning), lessons learned. Cut-by-cut detail recoverable
from git log.

**Reference doc** (`design-{feature}-reference.md`):
Optional artifact when a feature design has 5+ external claims needing
versioning, licensing, or citation. Houses the fact-check ledger. Below the
5-claim threshold, inline citations in the design doc are clearer.

**Companion docs block**:
Standard section near the top of every design doc listing the impl doc,
reference doc, and any ADRs that travel with the feature. Tells a cold
reader which docs go together. Format: `- [name](relative-path) — one-line
description`.

**Foundational checks**:
Required section in every new design doc answering each of the 13
foundational dimensions plus the multi-instance check. Documents the
feature's interaction (or non-interaction) with each. A feature designed
before a dimension's design pass has shipped MUST document the assumption
it's making about the pending dimension's contract.

**Punch list**:
Ordered, blast-radius-ranked list of cross-foundation integration test gaps
in [testing-plan.md](testing-plan.md), or deferred features in implementation
docs. Items land alongside the next feature cut that touches the relevant
foundation, not as a backlog batch.

**ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**:
Durable doc at `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md` for load-bearing decisions. Three
criteria, all required: hard to reverse, surprising without context, result
of a real trade-off. Most decisions live as "Distinctive choices" sections
in feature design docs; ADRs are reserved for the load-bearing few.

## Testing

**Storage tier**:
Test-isolation choice. `memoryStorage()` (fresh per test, ~10ms setup) is
the default; filesystem (`createFilesystemProvider` + `tempDir`) is required
only for tests exercising real binary I/O, hash-in-path filename
construction, file watcher, or starter-site smoke. See
[testing-plan.md](testing-plan.md) "Storage tier" section.

**Per-test isolation**:
Discipline that every test gets fresh storage / fresh tempdir; no
module-level state shared between tests; no implicit ordering dependency.
Vitest's serial-within-file mode is a soft guarantee, not a contract — code
defensively. Captured in [team-preferences.md rule 26](team-preferences.md).

**Mutation scope**:
The set of source modules currently subjected to StrykerJS mutation testing.
Expanded smallest-first so the workflow calibrates triage-time and
artifact-handling on focused surfaces before tackling large ones. See
[testing-plan.md](testing-plan.md).

**Mutation-area-picker (strategic)**:
Weekly autonomous bot that owns the `mutate` glob in
`stryker.config.json`. Manages a PORTFOLIO of mutated modules under a
runtime budget (currently ~1h 45m, hard ceiling 3h). Picks one of
ADD / SWAP / REMOVE / NOOP per cron based on risk-weighted heuristic
signals (AI-pairing density, test/source LOC ratio, churn, flake
correlation, bug-fix correlation) and empirical eviction per
[ADR-0014](../../docs/adr/0014-mutation-eviction-by-empirical-evidence.md)
(kill ratio sustained + fix rate met). Bootstrap weeks 1-4 do ADD-only.
Opens a draft PR on acting weeks; exits silently on NOOP weeks. NO
compactor in v1 — at ~52 decisions/year, signal volume is too thin to
justify one; deferred until skip-list crosses 10 entries OR reviewer-log
hits its 200-entry cache ceiling. Distinct from mutation-watcher
(consumes Stryker output) and from the mutation-target-prioritiser
(tactical, per-cron).

**Mutation-target-prioritiser (tactical)**:
Per-cron bot that re-ranks the "top-N actionable files" mutation-watcher
investigates each run. Default ranking today is "highest surviving-mutant
count first"; this bot widens that with cross-references (module
importance, mutant class, churn). Designed-but-deferred surface — earns
its place when actionable-file set grows large enough that count-only
ranking misses high-value targets. Distinct from mutation-area-picker
(strategic, monthly).

**Tautological tests**:
Tests written after observing the implementation's output, asserting on what
was observed rather than what should be true. Pass without proving anything;
caught by mutation testing and prevented by TDD-first ordering. Industry
mutation scores on AI-generated tests-after-implementation hover around 20%
— meaning ~80% of injected faults survive.

**TDD-first ordering**:
When delegating non-trivial code to an AI agent, write the failing test in
commit N, the implementation in commit N+1, and tell the agent "do not
modify the failing tests." Per [team-preferences.md rule 31](team-preferences.md).
The dominant failure mode of AI test-writing is tautology; this ordering
prevents it.

**Trophy / pyramid / honeycomb shape**:
Test-distribution shapes per sub-system. Core (renderer, hash, sidecars) is
**pyramid** (heavy unit). Storage providers are **honeycomb** (heavy
integration via testcontainers). Admin SPA is **trophy** (component +
scenario). CLI is **crab** (heavy scenario). The shape determines test-tier
defaults; rule 31 also references this for which tier API tests belong to.

## Git + workflow

**Rebase posture**:
Default git strategy. Main is rebase / fast-forward only — no merge commits,
linear history. Apply at every level: PR merge via `gh pr merge --rebase`,
PR-branch updates via `git fetch && git rebase origin/main`, conflict
resolution during rebase, stacked PRs rebased on each other. See
[team-preferences.md rule 16](team-preferences.md).

**Boy Scout rule**:
When passing through a file for a real change, fix small broken things you
see along the way (pre-existing type error, dead re-export, stale comment,
missing test, obvious typo). Scope stays tight to "cheap and adjacent." See
[team-preferences.md rule 19](team-preferences.md).

## Bots and skills

**Bot**:
Autonomous, scheduled, repo-scoped automation that runs in GitHub Actions
without human invocation. Lives under [`bots/`](../../bots/). Each has its
own subdirectory with `index.ts` + `prompt.md`, shares helpers from
[`bots/_lib/`](../../bots/_lib/), runs on a daily cron via
`.github/workflows/<bot-name>.yml`. Distinct from a Skill: bots run
unattended, skills are user-invoked.

**Skill**:
A reusable Claude prompt body with defined input + output contracts.
Lives under `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project-level, versioned
with the repo) or `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (global, cross-project).
Invokable in three modes:

- **Interactive** — user types `/<name>` in a Claude Code session; the
  skill walks them through a process step by step. Example: the
  [`triage`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-skills/tree/main/skills/triage)
  skill.
- **Headless** — a Bot orchestrator passes the skill's prompt body to
  `claude -p` non-interactively; orchestrator parses structured output
  (e.g. JSONL findings fence, `VERDICT:` line).
- **Sub-agent** — another Claude session spawns the skill via the
  `Agent` tool; output appears as that agent's final message; the
  parent session consumes it.

The same SKILL.md serves all three modes; the skill's input + output
contract is mode-agnostic. See [`bots/README.md`](../../bots/README.md)
"Producer vs consumer" for the rule that determines what work belongs
in the skill body (Claude judgment) vs the invoking orchestrator
(deterministic parsing). Distinct from a Bot: Skills are reusable
prompt artifacts; Bots are autonomous orchestrators that may invoke
Skills among other steps. The interactive `triage` skill and the
autonomous `triage-bot` cover the same domain at different audiences;
the interactive [`review-orchestrator`](../skills/review-orchestrator/SKILL.md)
skill and the autonomous `pr-review-bot` will follow the same pattern.

**Transcript**:
JSONL stream-json artifact written by [`bots/_lib/claude.ts`](../../bots/_lib/claude.ts)
on every bot's `claude -p` invocation. One JSON event per line: tool calls,
tool results, assistant messages. Uploaded as the `<bot-name>-transcripts`
GitHub Actions artifact (90-day retention). Read by future agents to
understand what a past bot run did and why; primary input to the replay loop.

**Decision log**:
Convention requiring bot prompts to instruct Claude to articulate
load-bearing choices inline as `> Decision: <why>` text blocks. The
transcript captures the WHAT (every tool call) automatically; the
decision log captures the WHY in Claude's own words. Skip narration of
trivial tool calls — only call out choices a reviewer would want explained.

**Outcome tag**:
Convention requiring every bot-authored comment or new issue body to end
with `<!-- <bot-name>: run=$RUN_ID -->`. Lets a future agent query
`gh issue list --search "<bot-name>: run=12345"` to find every issue a bot
touched in any past run, joining intent (transcript) with outcome (issue
tracker activity).

**Replay loop**:
The mechanism for improving a bot's prompt over time. Steps: download a past
workflow's transcripts artifact, identify quality issues, edit the prompt,
run `npm run replay -w @gazetta/bots <bot-name> <past-run-id>` which
re-invokes the current prompt against the same flakes the bot saw, write
new transcripts beside the originals, diff to evaluate. Documented in
[`bots/README.md`](../../bots/README.md).

**Hard exclusion**:
Triage-bot pattern. A category of issue (security keywords, CVE, etc.) that
the bot must NEVER deep-investigate because misclassification is dangerous.
Bot applies `needs-triage`, posts a deferral notice, and exits — no labels
beyond `needs-triage`, no investigation, no agent brief. Maintainer reviews
personally.

**Soft bail**:
Triage-bot pattern weaker than hard exclusion. A category where the bot
could try but is poorly equipped (visual / UI bugs without browser,
performance complaints without baseline). Bot applies labels, posts a brief
"out of my depth" comment, exits. Distinct from hard exclusion: soft bails
are about competence (bot can't add value), hard exclusions are about
safety (bot might cause harm).

**Investigation notes**:
Triage-bot artifact for the human running `/triage` next. Includes file
paths and line numbers (transient — they may go stale in weeks but are
immediately useful). Audience: maintainer. Distinct from an Agent brief:
notes are research findings; the brief is a durable spec the AFK agent
works from.

**Agent brief**:
Durable spec on a `ready-for-agent` issue, authored by a human (not the
bot) per
[`~/.claude/skills/triage/AGENT-BRIEF.md`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-skills/tree/main/skills/triage/AGENT-BRIEF.md).
Behavioral, not procedural. No file paths, no line numbers — those go stale
between when the brief is written and when the AFK agent picks it up. The
triage-bot does NOT write briefs; it writes Investigation notes and lets
the maintainer convert them.

**Disclaimer prefix**:
Convention requiring every AI-authored triage comment to start with
`> *This was generated by AI during triage.*`. Per the
[`triage` skill](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-skills/tree/main/skills/triage).
Lets maintainers scan an issue thread and immediately distinguish bot output
from human notes.

**Per-run budget**:
Bot pattern preventing GitHub Actions workflow timeout. Triage-bot sorts
candidates oldest-first, processes in order, exits gracefully when 50 min
elapsed (10 min margin from the 60-min workflow timeout). One-time backlog
spikes converge in 2-3 daily runs without ever hitting the timeout.

## Issue triage

**State role** / **Category role**:
Two label dimensions per the
[`triage` skill](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-skills/tree/main/skills/triage).
**Category roles**: `bug` | `enhancement`. **State roles**: `needs-triage`
| `needs-info` | `ready-for-agent` | `ready-for-human` | `wontfix`. Every
triaged issue carries exactly one of each. The triage-bot applies category
roles autonomously; advances confident bugs to `ready-for-agent` for
fix-bot to pick up; never advances to `needs-info` / `ready-for-human` /
`wontfix` (those require maintainer judgment via `/triage`).

**`needs-triage` (label)**:
Skill-canonical "no bot or human has looked yet" state. The bot does NOT
apply this label — once the bot has classified, the bot HAS looked. The
interactive `/triage` skill queries this label for issues the bot
hasn't gotten to (rare; typically only for issues filed before the bot
existed). Spelled with a hyphen per the skill's canonical name (the
project briefly used `needs triage` with a space — migrated 2026-05-10).

**`triage-uncertain` (label)**:
Bot looked but couldn't classify confidently. Applied by triage-bot when
the issue body has both bug-language AND enhancement-language, or
neither. The maintainer's primary morning queue:
`gh issue list --label triage-uncertain`. Steady-state target: 1-3 per
week. Distinct from `needs-triage` (which means "never been looked at").
The bot's lean (if any) goes in the comment body, not the label —
applying a category guess in the label would defeat the "trust labels
to mean confident classification" UX.

**`ready-for-human` (label)**:
Project-specific overload of the skill-canonical `ready-for-human` state
role. Used in three contexts:

- **discovery-prep-bot output**: "Discovery research posted as a comment;
  design grilling can start whenever the maintainer is ready."
- **fix-bot output (when stuck)**: "Tried but couldn't capture the bug as
  a failing test; needs human to write the test or close as wontfix."
- **Maintainer-applied via `/triage`**: Skill-canonical "needs human
  implementation, can't be delegated."

Disambiguate by reading the latest bot comment's outcome tag
(`<!-- discovery-prep-bot:` vs `<!-- fix-bot:`). The skill's canonical
"needs human implementation" usage is preserved — maintainer-applied
`ready-for-human` via `/triage` keeps that meaning. Three contexts on
one label is the trade-off accepted to avoid a new label per bot.

The label is also a pipeline gate: once applied, the issue is excluded
from triage-bot's and discovery-prep-bot's input queries. Maintainer
intervention is required to re-enter the bot pipeline (remove the
label).

**`flake` (label)**:
CI test-flake classification — intermittent failure, not a real bug until
proven otherwise via triage. Applied by flake-watcher to every issue it
files. Skipped only when the bot's hypothesis concludes the failure is
structurally a real bug masquerading as a flake (e.g. an equal-millisecond
ordering race). Provenance is captured by the outcome tag, not the label.

**`recurring-flake` (label)**:
Same flake observed three or more times across distinct days. Applied by
flake-watcher when the threshold is met. Signals "root-cause work should be
prioritized over continued tracking."

**Failure mode** (flake dedup grain):
The unit of flake dedup: same test path + same line (or same locator + same
symptom). Two failures of `publish.spec.ts:33` are the same mode; a failure
of `:33` and a failure of `:199` are different modes. Flake-watcher files
one issue per failure mode, not per test file — the right grain because
fixes correlate with mode, not file.

**First investigation vs subsequent investigations**:
Bot pattern. First investigation = labels applied + comment posted.
Subsequent investigations = append-only comments; labels never changed,
prior bot comments never edited. Detect by checking for any prior comment
starting with the AI disclaimer prefix.

## Flagged ambiguities

Terms the project once conflated. Resolved here so future use stays clean.

- **"Bot" vs "Skill"**: distinct surfaces (autonomous vs interactive). Don't
  call a skill a bot or vice versa.
- **"Agent brief" vs "Investigation notes" vs "Triage notes"**: three
  artifacts. Agent brief = durable spec the AFK agent works from, written
  by a human. Investigation notes = bot's research output for the maintainer
  running `/triage` next. Triage notes = informal term for what `/triage`
  produces interactively (no fixed format).
- **"Flake" the concept** (a test that intermittently fails) vs **"flake"
  the label** (provenance + classification by the flake-watcher bot).
  Resolved: the label classifies, doesn't merely tag bot provenance — the
  outcome tag handles provenance.
- **"Hard exclusion" vs "soft bail"**: both prevent the bot from
  investigating, but for different reasons. Hard = safety (bot might harm),
  soft = competence (bot can't help).
- **"Companion docs" block (in design doc)** vs **"Companion docs" the
  conceptual pairing of design + impl + reference**: same word, two scopes.
  The block is the load-bearing artifact.
