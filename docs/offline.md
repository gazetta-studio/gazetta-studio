# Offline mode

How Gazetta admin handles transient connectivity loss — what authors see,
what changes for operators, and what's intentionally not in v1.

For the design model + architectural locks, see
[`.claude/rules/design-offline.md`](../.claude/rules/design-offline.md).

## What it is

The admin keeps working when the network goes away. Pages already loaded
stay viewable, edits in progress aren't lost, and saves either land
silently when connection comes back or surface as something the author
can act on. The browser fetches the SPA bundle once and serves it from
disk on subsequent visits, including cold loads while offline.

This is offline-AWARE, not offline-FIRST. Authors don't choose to "go
offline"; offline is what happens to them. There's no toggle.

## What changes for authors

### Connection state

A thin strip appears at the top of the admin when the connection isn't
healthy:

| State | What you see | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Online | Nothing | Saves go through normally. The absence is the state. |
| Connection unstable | Subtle "Connection unstable" with spinner | Recent request failed; admin is probing the server. Editing keeps working. |
| Offline | Persistent "Offline" banner with "Send now" button | Server unreachable. Saves go to the local store and replay later. |
| Reconnecting | Subtle "Reconnecting" indicator | Server just answered; admin is catching up. Brief — usually a flash. |

When connection returns after offline, a transient toast says "Connection
back" so you know without checking the banner.

### Save behavior

Click Save the same way regardless of connection state. The button label
doesn't change between online and offline — your mental model is
"I clicked Save; it says saved."

What happens underneath:

| Situation | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Online; save succeeds | Standard. Editor goes clean. |
| Online; save fails partway (server crashed mid-response) | Admin checks what landed; either silently confirms success or surfaces an error. No silent loss. |
| Offline; save attempted | Saved locally. Will send when connection comes back. |
| Save attempted while someone else just saved the same item | "Was edited by someone else" banner with "Show what changed" + "Discard my changes" |

### "Was edited by someone else"

If the server's version of a page or fragment changed between when you
loaded it and when you tried to save (typical scenario: a colleague
edited the same item from another browser, or the file was edited
out-of-band by `git pull` or a text editor), you get a banner instead
of a silent overwrite.

Two actions:

- **Show what changed** — opens a field-by-field diff. "Title: 'Mine'
  vs 'Theirs.'" Object/array fields show "(changes inside)" without
  diving deep — at-a-glance information so you can decide.
- **Discard my changes** — drops your local edits and reloads the
  server's current version.

There's deliberately no "Save anyway / Overwrite" button. If you want
your changes on top of theirs, view the diff, manually port the edits
you care about onto the new version, and save fresh. Keeps the team
from accidentally clobbering each other's work.

### Pending edits across tabs and reload

Component reorders / adds / removes (the structural lane) survive
browser reload. If you reorder components on `/home`, then close the
tab and reopen it, the reordered tree is still there waiting for save.

Field-level edits (title text, content blocks) currently don't
persist across reload — they're held in browser memory until you save
or navigate. Persisting field edits across reload is in the roadmap.

### "Send now"

When you're offline and the admin says it's offline, but you know the
network is actually back (you just reconnected to Wi-Fi, or the VPN
came up), click "Send now" on the offline banner. The admin probes
immediately rather than waiting for the next scheduled check.

This is purely a hint to the admin's heartbeat scheduler — it doesn't
override anything. If the network really is down, the probe just
fails again and the banner stays.

### Storage warning

If your browser's local storage approaches its cap (around 80%), a
subtle banner appears: "Storage almost full — please connect to send
your saved items." Dismissing the banner suppresses it at that level;
it reappears only if usage climbs strictly above the dismissal point.

This is rare in practice. The admin's persistent storage is small
(query results + structural pending edits); the warning fires when
the whole-origin storage budget is being consumed by something else
(other apps on the same domain, browser caches accumulating).

## What v1 does NOT do

Setting expectations honestly. These items are deliberately not in v1
and have specific triggers to revisit.

### No replay while the tab is closed

If you save offline, close the tab, then reconnect: the save sends on
your **next admin open**, not in the background. The browser would
need a service worker with [Background Sync](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Synchronization_API)
to do this — possible technically, but adds machinery for marginal
value (authors reopen the admin to check status anyway).

### No live multi-author concurrent editing

Two authors editing the same page simultaneously can both type freely;
the second one to save sees the "Was edited by someone else" banner.
There's no live cursor / presence indicator showing "Bob is also
editing this." That kind of real-time collaboration requires a
persistent connection layer (WebSocket / SSE-with-back-channel) and
conflict-free data structures (OT or CRDT) — its own design space,
not in this v1 scope.

### Not installable as a PWA

The admin runs in a regular tab. There's no install prompt, no
home-screen icon, no standalone window mode. The service worker is
scoped to caching the SPA bundle for offline-reload reliability,
not full PWA installation.

### No push notifications

If a colleague edits content while you're not looking at the admin,
you find out the next time you open the affected page (via the
"Was edited by someone else" banner). No browser notification
("Bob saved /home").

## Operator concerns

### Browser support

Hard requirements for the offline experience to work at all:

| Browser | IndexedDB | BroadcastChannel | Service Worker | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chrome 80+ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Fully supported |
| Edge (Chromium) 80+ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Fully supported |
| Firefox 78+ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Fully supported |
| Safari 15.4+ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Fully supported |
| Safari < 15.4 | partial | partial | ✓ | Degrades gracefully |
| Private / incognito modes | usually disabled | varies | varies | Falls back to in-memory |

When IndexedDB is unavailable, the admin warns once via console and
falls back to in-memory storage — works for the tab session, lost on
reload. Authors using private browsing should expect the warning.

### HTTPS requirement

Service workers require HTTPS in production. Localhost development
works on HTTP. This was already a Gazetta requirement for auth
cookies — no new constraint introduced by offline mode.

If you're serving the admin behind a reverse proxy, terminate TLS at
the proxy (Caddy, nginx, Cloudflare) and pass through. The admin's
service worker registers at `/admin/sw.js` and scopes to `/admin/`.

### What needs to be deployed

Nothing extra. Offline mode is built into the admin SPA; the service
worker ships in the same `dist/` bundle as `index.html` and the JS/CSS
chunks. Standard `gazetta serve` or any static host serving the
admin works.

If you're behind a CDN, make sure `sw.js` isn't aggressively cached
by an intermediary — when a new admin version ships, the SW file at
`/admin/sw.js` needs to update so users get the toast. A short
`Cache-Control` (e.g., `no-cache`, `max-age=0`) on `sw.js`
specifically is the right move; the chunks it precaches have
content-hashed filenames and can be cached forever.

### Configuration

The defaults are correct. There are no required knobs. If you need to
opt out (corporate environments that block service workers, sandboxed
deployments), the admin still works — connection-state and save-conflict
detection don't depend on the SW; only the cold-load-while-offline
path does.

### Update flow

When you publish a new version of Gazetta and authors load the admin:

1. The browser fetches `/admin/sw.js`. If the content changed (it does
   on every release), the SW enters the "waiting" state.
2. Within an hour (or on next page reload), the admin detects the
   waiting SW and shows a toast: "A new version is available — Refresh."
3. The author clicks "Refresh." The SW activates and the page reloads
   with the new bundle.

Users running with one tab open all day get the toast; users who close
and reopen pick up the new version on the next load. No silent
upgrades — if an author is mid-edit, they see the toast but aren't
forced to refresh until they choose.

### Verifying it works

Quick check after deploying a new version:

```
1. Open the admin in a normal tab → admin loads.
2. DevTools → Application → Service Workers → confirm /admin/sw.js
   is registered + active.
3. DevTools → Application → Storage → confirm IndexedDB has a
   `gazetta-cache` database.
4. DevTools → Network → throttle to "Offline."
5. Reload the page.
6. Admin should still load (from SW cache) with the "Offline" banner
   at the top.
7. Throttle back to "Online."
8. Banner replaces with brief "Connection back" toast; admin
   reconnects.
```

If step 5 shows "site can't be reached" rather than the admin loading
offline, the service worker isn't registered correctly. Check that
`/admin/sw.js` is reachable directly (HTTP 200, `Content-Type:
application/javascript`).

### Multi-instance deployments

If you run the admin behind a load balancer with multiple instances:

- Each browser tab talks to one instance at a time. Offline state and
  save conflicts are detected per-tab; nothing flows across instances
  in the offline path.
- IndexedDB storage is per-browser-origin, not per-instance — same
  storage regardless of which instance the tab last hit.
- Service worker registration is per-origin; load-balanced instances
  serving the same `/admin/sw.js` content (which they should, if they
  shipped the same admin build) is the standard pattern.

### Troubleshooting

**"Was edited by someone else" appears unexpectedly.**

Either someone really did edit the page (check the audit log when
audit ships in a future release), or the file was changed on disk
out-of-band — `git pull`, manual `sed`, an editor watching the
filesystem, etc. The admin compares the manifest's content hash
between your read and your write; any change between those two
moments triggers the conflict.

**Banner says "Offline" but I can browse other sites.**

The admin probes `GET /api/health`. If that endpoint is reachable
but returning errors (5xx), the admin treats it as offline — the
server is up but unhealthy. Check the admin process logs for the
underlying cause.

**Service worker doesn't update.**

Force a refresh in DevTools → Application → Service Workers →
"Update on reload" + click "Update." If the new SW still isn't
served, the `/admin/sw.js` URL is being cached by an intermediary
(CDN, proxy). Add a short `Cache-Control` to the SW URL specifically.

**IndexedDB warning in console.**

Most likely the user is in private browsing. Admin still works,
just without persistence — refresh loses tab-session state.
Document this for users who need to know; nothing to fix on the
operator side.

## Roadmap

What's deferred in v1 with documented triggers to revisit:

- **Persisted field edits across reload** — title / content text in
  the editor doesn't survive browser close yet. Lands when the
  closure-rebuild flow for the editor's save state ships.
- **Replay while tab closed (Background Sync)** — see "What v1 does
  NOT do" above.
- **Live multi-author concurrent editing** — Tier 3 strategic bet;
  needs OT/CRDT design.
- **Audit integration** — replayed save events should mark
  `metadata.replayed: true` with the original-attempt timestamp.
  Lands when the audit-log foundation ships.
