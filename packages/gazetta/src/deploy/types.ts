 * Type contract for the DeployAdapter Pattern 1 Provider surface.
 *
 * Cut 1 of the deploy contract — the interface, capability extension,

 * first real adapter (Cut 3 — `cloudflareWorkersDeploy`), and docs
 * (Cut 4). Per ADR-0008, operators wire adapters via factory calls
 * returning a constructed `DeployAdapter`; the field type IS the
 * runtime interface.
 *
 * Reference: `.claude/rules/design-deploy.md` "The contract" section.
 *
 * Note: `supports: readonly TargetType[]` is forward-compatible with
 * `design-rendering.md` Q1's three-target-type taxonomy (`'static' |
 * 'esi' | 'dynamic'`). Today's `TargetType` is `'static' | 'dynamic'`;
 * Cut 1 of design-rendering.md widens it to include `'esi'`. Adapters
 * declaring `supports: ['static'] as const` today continue compiling
 * after that widening.

 * - `execute(ctx)` — run the deploy. Throws `DeployError` variants on
 *   failure; returns `DeployResult` on success.
 * - `validate?(ctx)` — optional pre-flight validation for cross-field
 *   invariants beyond target-type compatibility (e.g., "Cloudflare
 *   Workers requires bucket binding"). Returns the standard `Issue[]`
 *   shape from design-validation.md; runs at `cli` + `pre-publish`
