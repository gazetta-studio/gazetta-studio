/**
 * Role resolution — translates upstream group claims into a Gazetta
 * role + the role's capability set.
 *
 * # The resolution chain
 *
 *   1. Pull the group list from the principal's claims (header /
 *      JWT payload — provider-specific, surfaces as a `string[]`)
 *   2. Walk the operator's `roleMapping.map` from `site.config.ts`;
 *      first matching upstream group → Gazetta role name
 *   3. Fall back to `roleMapping.defaultRole` if no group matches;
 *      `null` means deny access
 *   4. Expand the role name to its capability set via
 *      `expandRole(name, customRoles)`
 *
 * # Why "first match wins" not "highest precedence"
 *
 * Per `design-auth-rbac.md` Q3 lock: priority is array order in the
 * map config. Operators control precedence by ordering their map.
 * Predictable, deterministic, no implicit precedence.
 *
 * # SOLID lenses
 *
 *   - SRP: pure function over (groups, mapping, customRoles);
 *     doesn't read `site.config.ts` directly, doesn't depend on
 *     specific provider shape.
 *   - DIP: providers pass the resolved groups; this module doesn't
 *     know about JWT claims or HTTP headers.
