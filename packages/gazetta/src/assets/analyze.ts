/**
 * Format-specific upload analyzers — the seam where formats contribute
 * manifest fields and supplementary files alongside the primary bytes.
 *
 * # Why a peer abstraction to `UploadPreprocessor`
 *
 * Preprocessors transform input bytes (SVG sanitization, future EXIF
 * orientation flatten, future HEIC→JPEG transcode). They run BEFORE
 * the hash — the sanitized/transformed bytes are what we content-
 * address.
 *
 * Analyzers read the final bytes (post-preprocess, hash settled) and
 * produce two kinds of output:
 *
 *   - **Manifest enrichment** — format-specific fields. Animated GIF
 *     contributes `animated: true`, `frames: N`, `duration: ms`.
 *     Audio contributes `duration`. PDF could contribute `pageCount`.
 *   - **Supplementary files** — extra byte writes alongside the
 *     primary asset. Animated images contribute a first-frame
 *     `poster.png`. Future PDF analysis contributes a first-page
 *     thumbnail. Future audio analysis contributes a waveform image.
 *
 * Folding manifest enrichment + bytes-transform into one interface
 * was rejected: distinct lifecycles (pre-hash vs post-hash), distinct
 * concerns, distinct test shapes. Two interfaces per SRP.
 *
 * # SOLID lenses
 *
 *   - SRP: each analyzer owns one format's "read bytes, return
 *     metadata + extras"
 *   - OCP: adding a format = new analyzer module + register; ingest
 *     unchanged
 *   - LSP: every analyzer honors `(mime, bytes) → AnalysisResult`
 *   - ISP: analyzer interface is small; ingest depends on the
 *     `runAnalyzers` function, not on individual analyzers
 *   - DIP: ingest depends on the abstraction; analyzers implement it
 *
 * Adding a new format-specific analyzer is one new module + one
 * registration. Ingest stays generic.
