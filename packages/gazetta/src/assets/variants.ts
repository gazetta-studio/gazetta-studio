/**
 * Responsive-variant generation for image assets.
 *
 * Single responsibility: given the original bytes of an image, produce
 * resized variants at the v1 target widths. No storage, no manifest, no
 * naming policy — callers (ingest pipeline) compose this with byte
 * persistence and manifest writing.
 *
 * v1 target widths: 400 / 800 / 1200 / 1600. Variants wider than the
 * source image are skipped (no upscaling — the browser's srcset picker
 * is happy with fewer candidates, and upscaled variants would be worse
 * than the original). Same format as input (JPEG → JPEG, PNG → PNG).
 *
 * Format conversion (WebP/AVIF emission) is a separate capability and
 * lives out of scope for this module.
