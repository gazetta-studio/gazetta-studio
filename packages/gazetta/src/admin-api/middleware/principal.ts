/**
 * Principal middleware — wires the auth/RBAC layer (`packages/gazetta/src/auth/`)
 * into the Hono request context.
 *
 * # What this middleware does
 *
 * 1. On boot, constructs the configured `AuthIdentityProvider` from
 *    `admin.auth` in the loaded SiteManifest. Falls back to the
 *    `none`-mode provider when `admin.auth` is absent.
 * 2. On every request, calls `provider.extractPrincipal(req)` and
 *    attaches the result to `c.var.principal`.
 * 3. Anonymous requests (provider returns `null`) get a synthesized
 *    Principal with `id: 'unknown'` + `role: 'unknown'` + empty
 *    capabilities. The capability-check middleware (Cut 8) decides
 *    whether to allow these (none-mode or public routes) or 401.
 * 4. Provider throws (`AuthenticationError`) → 401 with the error
 *    message; doesn't leak details about the underlying failure.
 *
 * # Capability population
 *
 * For `forwarded-user` and `cloudflare-access` providers (which can
 * surface upstream group claims), this middleware would call
 * `resolveRole({ groups, mapping, customRoles })` to expand the
 * principal's capabilities. v1 wires the role-resolver in a
 * follow-up cut once one of the providers actually exposes group
 * claims through the AuthRequest shape — for now the providers
 * return `capabilities: []` and the operator's role mapping config
 * doesn't reach the resolver yet.
 *
 * # Why this is its own middleware (not folded into the existing one)
 *
 * The existing `authMiddleware` is a simple bearer-token guard for
 * `GAZETTA_TOKEN` — orthogonal to upstream-identity extraction.
 * They compose: bearer-token gates "is this request allowed to
 * reach the admin API at all"; principal middleware identifies
 * "who is the user behind this request." Most deployments use
 * one or the other (bearer-token for solo / dev; principal for
 * team CMS); some compose both (CI pipeline auth-token + upstream
 * Cloudflare Access for human users).
 *
 * # SOLID lenses
 *
 *   - SRP: extracts identity + attaches to context. Authorization
 *     (capability checks) is Cut 8's middleware.
 *   - DIP: depends on `AuthIdentityProvider` interface, not on
 *     specific provider classes.
