/**
 * Boot-time capability-gap inspection — surface #1 of the four-point
 * capability-gap UX pattern.
 *
 * Per `design-soft-delete.md` Q10 lock + `feature-design-process.md`
 * non-foundational discipline: at admin boot, walk every configured
 * target and warn about runtime capability gaps. Non-blocking — admin
 * starts. The warning gives operators an early signal during deploy
 * so misconfiguration surfaces before content authors hit the gap at
 * publish time.
 *
 * Pairs with:
 *   - Surface #2 (author modal): consumes `/api/targets` extended
 *     payload with capability info (Cut 10 wires the UI)
 *   - Surface #3 (validator scanner): `archive-not-supported-on-target`
 *     P4 validator from Cut 8 reports per-archived-item gaps
 *   - Surface #4 (pre-publish gate): `/api/publish/audit` includes
 *     per-target capability info when archived items are in scope
 *
 * # SOLID
 *
 *   - SRP: this module owns ONE concern — emit warnings at boot.
 *     Doesn't inspect targets itself (delegates to runtime-capabilities);
 *     doesn't render the warnings (consumes the existing console.warn
 *     pattern).
 *   - DIP: depends on the `inspectTarget` predicate, not on target-config
 *     parsing details.

/**
 * Walk the site's targets at boot; emit a warning per target that
 * has any capability gap. Logs are operator-facing — once
 * `design-logging.md`'s structured logger ships, replace `console.warn`
 * with `log.warn({ module: 'admin-api.capability-gap', ... })`.
 *
 * Idempotent: calling twice produces the same warnings. The caller
 * (admin-api boot path) calls once.
 *
 * @returns the count of targets with gaps — useful for tests.
