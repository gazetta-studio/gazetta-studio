/**
 * Higher-level helper for recording revisions on a target.
 *
 * The bare `HistoryProvider.recordRevision` takes a full
 * `items: Map<path, content>` snapshot. That's fine for testing but
 * wasteful at runtime: every save of one page would re-hash and
 * re-list every page + fragment on the target. This helper does the
 * right thing:
 *
 *   - First revision on a target: walks the content tree once to
 *     snapshot every manifest (page.json, fragment.json, site.yaml).
 *   - Subsequent revisions: reads the previous snapshot and overlays
 *     the delta (changed items the caller passes in). `readBlob` for
 *     each carried-over path gives us the content for the new
 *     revision's items map — at which point `recordRevision` dedupes
 *     the unchanged blobs via content-addressing, so no new storage.
 *
 * SRP: this module owns the "what goes in a revision snapshot"
 * decision. `HistoryProvider` owns layout. Callers (admin-api save /
 * admin-api publish / CLI publish) just describe *what they wrote*
 * and we construct the revision.
