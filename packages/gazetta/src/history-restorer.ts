/**
 * Apply a past revision's snapshot to a target's content tree.
 *
 * This is the write side of undo / rollback. Design-publishing.md:
 *   "Undo and rollback restore a prior revision — both are soft
 *    (forward-only; create a new revision reverting to the past state,
 *    never destroy history)."
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Load the target revision's snapshot (itemPath → blob hash).
 *   2. Diff against the current on-disk content (via the HistoryProvider's
 *      most-recent revision). Anything present now but absent from the
 *      target snapshot is deleted; everything in the snapshot is written
 *      from its blob.
 *   3. Record a new revision with operation='rollback' and
 *      restoredFrom=<targetRevId>, so the audit trail shows where the
 *      state came from and history stays forward-only.
 *
 * The caller (admin-api / CLI) owns orchestration — picking which
 * revision to restore (head-1 for undo, arbitrary for rollback) and
 * any side effects beyond the content tree (e.g., sidecar writer
 * invalidation).
