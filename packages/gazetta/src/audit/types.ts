/**
 * Audit types — the durable forensic record shape consumed by every
 * `AuditProvider` implementation.
 *
 * # Why these types live here
 *
 * Per `design-audit.md`'s "history-recorder is the foundation"
 * invariant, the audit log extends the existing `Revision` shape
 * with `actor` + `outcome` fields. The types here are the wire
 * shape every provider speaks; in-tree `HistoryAuditProvider`
 * (Cut 2) and external-sink providers (v2 webhook, file, OTel,
 * CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, syslog) all consume `AuditEvent`.
 *
 * # Outcome is required
 *
 * Per the locked invariant: "no implicit 'default to success' —
 * recording sites supply outcome explicitly. Cuts a class of 'I
 * forgot to record the failure' bugs." The closed enum stays
 * closed (future additions like `'rate-limited'`, `'session-expired'`
 * extend the enum, not the wire shape).
 *
 * # SOLID lenses
 *
 *   - SRP: this module owns the event vocabulary. Doesn't read
 *     storage; pure data shapes.
 *   - DIP: providers, recorder, drawer all depend on these types
 *     — never on which specific provider produced an event.
 *   - LSP: every `AuditProvider` returns events shaped by these
 *     types; consumers branch only on `outcome` / `action` for
 *     behavior, never on which provider produced the data.

/**
 * Closed enum of action verbs Gazetta records. Per `design-audit.md`
 * "Recording scope (v1)": save / publish / delete / restore at the
 * content level + configure-roles for role-mapping changes in
 * site.config.ts. `hook-fired` extends per design-hooks.md Cut 7.
 *
 * Soft-delete (per design-soft-delete.md Q8) extends with
 * `archive` / `unarchive` / `purge` / `rename` — each maps to one
 * user action; `rename` is recorded as a single composite event with
 * `metadata.fromName` for forensic reconstruction (per Q8 M4 lock).
 *
 * Redirect UI (per design-redirect-ui.md Q7) extends with
 * `create-redirect` — Manual Redirect creation (standalone, not
 * composed during a rename). The closed-enum discriminator over
 * `metadata.manual: true` keeps `AuditQuery.action` forensic queries
 * reliable ("show all manual redirects last week").
