/**
 * target-deploy-coverage (Cut 2 of #203).
 *
 * Per Q6 of the deploy design pass: container deploys don't ship as
 * Gazetta adapters — `gazetta serve` runs inside the container, and
 * platform CLIs (`flyctl`, `gcloud run deploy`, etc.) handle the
 * deploy step. The validator surfaces the capability gap so operators
 * see "this target has runtime constraints but no deploy adapter —
 * make sure your platform deploy is wired correctly."
 *
 * # Stage + severity
 *
 * `cli` only, info severity. The condition is informational, not an
 * error — many legitimate setups (container hosts) leave `deploy:`
 * unset on purpose. Info points operators to
 * `docs/container-deployment.md` for recipes.
 *
 * # When the validator fires
 *
 *   - target.type is 'dynamic' (or 'esi' once design-rendering.md
 *     Cut 1 widens the enum)
 *   - target has no `deploy:` configured
 *   - target's `environment` is NOT 'local'
 *
 * Local targets are skipped because they're typically `gazetta dev` /
 * `gazetta serve` self-hosted shapes that don't need a platform
 * deploy adapter at all.
 *
 * # Why environment instead of storage-type discriminator
 *
 * `StorageProvider` has no public discriminator field — providers are
 * closure-returned objects matching the same interface. Detecting
 * "is this filesystem?" would require either an instanceof check
 * against an internal class (couples the validator to provider
 * implementation) or a duck-type test (brittle, false-negative on
 * filesystem-shaped custom providers). Using `environment: 'local'`
 * leans on an existing, operator-visible discriminator with clear
 * semantics.
 *
 * # SOLID
 *
 *   - SRP: one rule — coverage check on (target.type, deploy presence,
 *     environment).
 *   - OCP: future target.type values flow through unchanged.
 *   - DIP: depends on `TargetConfig` shape, not on provider concretions.
