/**
 * Service-worker update flow per `design-offline.md` Cut 11
 * "Update detection UX":
 *
 *   - Boot registers the SW (via vite-plugin-pwa's
 *     `useRegisterSW` virtual module)
 *   - When a new SW version is detected, show a toast: "New version
 *     available — Refresh to update"
 *   - Author clicks "Refresh" → SW activates (skipWaiting) +
 *     reloads the tab
 *
 * The toast uses the existing `useToastStore.show(... { action })`
 * affordance — same UI surface as the post-save Undo prompt and
 * the back-to-previous-target after a target switch. Consistent
 * action affordance, consistent dismiss timing.
 *
 * # SOLID lenses
 *
 *   - SRP: this composable owns "update detection → toast prompt
 *     → activation handshake." It does NOT own the SW source
 *     (sw.ts) or the toast UI (App.vue / Toast.vue).
 *   - DIP: depends on the toast store interface, not on a specific
 *     toast UI component.
 *
 * # Why a composable, not a Pinia store
 *
 * The state is fundamentally tied to vite-plugin-pwa's reactive
 * registration object — the `needRefresh` ref is owned by the
 * plugin. A Pinia store would mirror that ref through another
 * layer for no benefit. Composable is the right shape: imported
 * once, runs side effects (register + watch), no consumer reads
 * its return value.
 *
 * # Production-only
 *
 * Vite's `useRegisterSW` is a no-op in dev because the SW isn't
 * built or registered there. Importing this composable in dev is
 * harmless (no-op subscription) — but the production behavior is
 * the only behavior we test in CI's prod-build smoke.
