/**
 * Admin service worker — app-shell precache only per
 * `design-offline.md` Cut 11 scope.
 *
 * # What this SW does
 *
 *   - Precaches the admin SPA bundle (HTML/JS/CSS chunks listed in
 *     `self.__WB_MANIFEST` — injected by `vite-plugin-pwa`'s
 *     injectManifest strategy at build time).
 *   - Serves precached responses on cold-load when the network is
 *     unavailable. Without this, an offline cold-load gets "site
 *     can't be reached"; with this, the SPA bundle loads, the L6
 *     `IndexedDBCache` hydrates state, and the app renders.
 *   - Listens for `SKIP_WAITING` messages from the page so the
 *     update-available toast can activate the new SW immediately
 *     when the user clicks "Refresh."
 *
 * # What this SW does NOT do
 *
 *   - Background sync (deferred to v2 — replay queued saves while
 *     the tab is closed; the design-offline.md trade-off says
 *     "authors reopen admin to check sync status; replay-on-next-
 *     open is acceptable v1 UX")
 *   - Push notifications (deferred until `NotificationProvider`
 *     extension surface ships per `design-collaboration.md`)
 *   - Runtime API caching (admin-API responses cache through
 *     `IndexedDBCache` per Cut 2; SW doesn't intercept /api/*)
 *   - PWA install prompt (manifest.webmanifest disabled in
 *     vite.config.ts; v1 is offline-aware, not installable)
 *
 * # SOLID lenses
 *
 *   - SRP: this file owns "precache the app shell + handle update
 *     activation." Cache providers (IndexedDB, MemoryCache fallback)
 *     are siblings; the heartbeat + connection state lives in Pinia
 *     stores; conflict resolution lives in components.
 *   - Future extension: when v2 background sync ships, it lands as
 *     a separate fetch handler in this same file; the precache
 *     plumbing stays.

 * and on click sends `SKIP_WAITING` to this worker. We respond by
 * skipping the wait phase so the new SW activates immediately.
 *
 * Without skipWaiting, the new SW would sit in the `installed` state
 * until every tab using the old SW closed — which for a long-lived
 * admin tab is forever. The toast → click → skipWaiting handshake
 * gives the user explicit control over the activation moment.
