/**
 * Asset list — fetch the list of assets from the active target, cache in
 * memory, expose refresh semantics.
 *
 * Single responsibility: listing. No uploads, no selection, no modal state.
 *
 * Loading semantics:
 * - `loaded` is `false` until the first successful fetch completes
 * - `loading` is `true` only while a fetch is in flight (never overlaps —
 *   concurrent calls are deduped via an in-flight promise, not queued)
 * - `error` holds the last failure message; refresh clears it
 *
 * Injected api (`loadList`) matches the pattern in activeTarget.ts — tests
 * can swap the transport without mocking the api client module.
